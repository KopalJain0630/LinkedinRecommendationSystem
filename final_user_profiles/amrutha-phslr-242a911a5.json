These processes have been designed keeping in view the criterion of minimal stress generation, microstructure retentivity, and process reproducibility. Narrow gap laser welding (NGLW) is one such advanced welding technique that has been developed in the past decade owing to its fabricate-ability of thick-section steels at high welding speeds. Of the many advantages, several characteristics of the process outperform the traditional arc welding processes as well as single-pass autogenous laser welding, including process flexibility, increased welding productivity, excellent weld properties, and the potential for automation. This paper provides a state-of-the-art technological review on the NGLW process primarily for structural steels covering several topics including the effect of process parameters, structure-property relationship, and induced defects and residual stresses of NGLWed joints. A list of future research recommendations based on several research gaps is also reported in this article.\"}]",

            "description": "The nanostructures were synthesized using three routes viz., co-precipitation, hydrothermal and reflux. Cubes, nanoflakes and hierarchical morphologies were formed via co-precipitation, hydrothermal and reflux methods, respectively. Physiochemical characterization (XRD, FTIR, BET, Particle size and SEM) for the NiO samples indicated the usefulness of these particles for energy storage devices. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge measurements, using three-electrode configuration in 1M, 2M and 3M KOH electrolytes. The electrochemical results indicated that the performance of hollow spheres were greater as compared to cube or flake-like structures, the reasons for which are explained. Finally, symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor devices were fabricated with best performing morphology as both electrodes for symmetric device and graphene oxide as the negative electrode as the positive electrode for asymmetric device. The energy density and power density of asymmetric device were ~18 Wh Kg-1 and ~4800 W Kg-1 respectively."

            "description": "Titanium alloys have been widely applied in aerospace, offshore and biomedical fields. The alloy Ti6Al4V has a property of biocompatibility and biofunctionality, hence is used as prosthesis and dentistry implants in human body. The powders of Ti6Al4V were produced by the process of vacuum atomization which resulted in powders of spherical morphology and were found to have an average size of 38\u00ce\u00bcm. According to Shunyu Liu et al.(2018),the powders were additively manufactured using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF)process which resulted in Liquid Phase Sintering (LPS) as stated by H. Yeung et al.(2020) of the powder beds. The additively manufactured alloy produces high amount of porosity which allows ingrowth of bone into the implants. Essentially, the spherical powders allow heat conduction phenomenon in the radial direction. Hence, the heat transfer rate in radial direction for part powder conduction at different plane depths was computed using MATLAB.The depths of powder beds used were 20.5mm, 41mm, 102.5mm, 205mm, 410mm and 615mm as mentioned in the paper by Wenyou Zhanget al.(2019). A general equation for the radial conduction phenomenon was computed and an algorithm for determining the time and temperature profile for any depth of powder was developed. The datasets were used to compute the time and temperature profiles which determined the variation of heat transfer rate with respect to increase in powder bed depth. The relation between powder depth and final temperature were found followed by finding the factors affecting the whole process. It was concluded that the rate of heat transfer tends to become exponential with increase in powder bed depth. Also, the final temperature attained by the powder bed decreased with increase in the depth of powder bed. Finally, it can be said that, the behavior of alloy towards heat depends on its thermal conductivity and latent heat of fusion."

            "description": "Hot deformation under constant strain rate of Mg-2Al Alloy resulted in stress peaks which essentially determine the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in the material. An ASTM short sample was tested in DARTEC hot compression machine and the graph plotted was computed in MATLAB to establish the onset of DRX using the strain hardening rate \u00ce\u00b8 and true stress \u00cf\u0192. The inflections in the curve were evidently used to obtain the peak stress and corresponding peak strain. The critical stress which arises just before the specimen reaches its peak stress value was also conveniently obtained from the inflection in the graph of \u00e2\u20ac\u201cd\u00ce\u00b8/d\u00ce\u00b5 and \u00cf\u0192. The experiment reveals that, for a given material the ratio of critical stress to peak stress or to their corresponding strains is a constant. Furthermore, this study helps in determining the onset of DRX for the materials which do not show peaks in their stress - strain curves."
