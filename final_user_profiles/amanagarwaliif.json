The frequency and extent of financial debacles have led the masses to call for reforms in the form of a new \\\"international financial architecture and a self sufficiency model\\\" with improved financial literacy. This paper believes that markedly better financial literacy has the capacity to improve macroeconomic growth. The Goal Programming Model for making multi-objective, capital structure decisions using accounting proxies has been tested on an Indian Agricultural Firm. The model may prove highly beneficial to firms hoping to achieve optimum or satisfying practical solutions to capital structure decisions that incorporate multiple goals in a systematic and scientific way.In the re-emergence of a multi-polar economic world, building a stable and growth-oriented future for all nations will require freedom from barriers and the free flow of market mechanisms as part of this large society. Building the future of all nations requires a focus on the social security facilities aimed at the fulfillment and maintenance of senior citizens’ dignities, environments and social equilibriums.\"},{\"title\":\"Building Nations Future in Global Disequilibrium's: Anti-crisis programs & priorities in Post Crisis Development in Times of Recession\",\"subtitle\":\"Economy Transdisciplinarity Cognition published by George Bacovia University, ROMAINIA, Vol 13, No. 1, pp. 7-33 (Lead Article)\",\"date\":\"2010\"},{\"title\":\"The Changing structure of world investment trade, capital flows and its impact on global integration regional cooperation\",\"subtitle\":\"Finance India, Vol 20, No 2, June 2006 pp. 471-490\",\"date\":\"Jun 2006\"},{\"title\":\"A Business Strategy for Growth (Joint Ventures, Mergers and Acquisitions)\",\"subtitle\":\"Effective Executive, Vol I, November 2004, A magazine of Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India (ICFAI) University, ICFAI Press Hyderabad, India\",\"date\":\"Nov 2004\"},{\"title\":\"Financing Growth through Self-Assessment Governance and Total Quality Growth Model\",\"subtitle\":\"Lahore Journal of Economics, Vol. 9, No. 1, June 2004, PAKISTAN\",\"date\":\"Jun 2004\"},{\"title\":\"Financing Growth through Self-Assessment Governance and Total Quality Growth Model\",\"subtitle\":\"Lahore Journal of Economics, Vol. 9, No. 1, June 2004, PAKISTAN\",\"date\":\"Jun 2004\"},{\"title\":\"Financing of Power Projects\",\"subtitle\":\"Indian Hydropower Association Conference, Volume 2004, March 2004\",\"date\":\"Mar 2004\"},{\"title\":\"Joint Ventures, Mergers & Acquisitions: A business Strategy\",\"subtitle\":\"Malaysian Journal of Management\",\"date\":\"2003\"},{\"title\":\"Joint Ventures, Mergers & Acquisitions: A business Strategy\",\"subtitle\":\"Malaysian Journal of Management\",\"date\":\"2003\"}]",
