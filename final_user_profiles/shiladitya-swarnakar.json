The purpose of the project was to reduce that asymmetry to some extent.Description: A team of 6 people scrapped around 5k LinkedIn profiles, using Selenium and BS4 ( Python API), pre-processed and used Topic Modelling (LDA) to predict topics from the corpus namely Marketing, Finance, Operations and Human Resource. Post that, query entered by the user is fitted by keyword matching and allocated to a topic bucket. Using Jensen Shannon Divergence we picked the top 10 people from the topic bucket that is best described by the query.
