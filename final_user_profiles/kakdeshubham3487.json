This forms dynamic and learnable KGEs for seamless integration into the transformer architecture. We investigate the influence of this integration into seminal architectures such as PatchTST, Autoformer, Informer, and Vanilla Transformer.\"},{\"title\":\"Pretraining Data and Tokenizer for Indic LLM\",\"subtitle\":\"arXiv\",\"date\":\"July 17, 2024\",\"description\":\"We present a novel approach to data preparation for developing multilingual Indic large language model. Our meticulous data acquisition spans open-source and proprietary sources, including Common Crawl, Indic books, news articles, and Wikipedia, ensuring a diverse and rich linguistic representation. For each Indic language, we design a custom preprocessing pipeline to effectively eliminate redundant and low-quality text content. Additionally, we perform deduplication on Common Crawl data to address the redundancy present in 70% of the crawled web pages. This study focuses on developing high-quality data, optimizing tokenization for our multilingual dataset for Indic large language models with 3B and 7B parameters, engineered for superior performance in Indic languages. We introduce a novel multilingual tokenizer training strategy, demonstrating our custom-trained Indic tokenizer outperforms the state-of-the-art OpenAI Tiktoken tokenizer, achieving a superior token-to-word ratio for Indic languages.\"},{\"title\":\"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Agri-Food Supply Chain\",\"subtitle\":\"SSRN\",\"date\":\"June 17, 2024\",\"description\":\"This paper investigates applying DRL techniques such as Q-learning, Deep Q Learning (DQL), and the Actor-Critic to manage agri-food supply chain effectively. Our analysis demonstrates these models can significantly enhance decision-making processes across various supply chain stages, thus improving efficiency and increasing profit margins. We incorporate a supply chain through comprehensive simulations and empirical evaluations, considering real-world practical scenarios.\"},{\"title\":\"CPAN chart: A Novel Customer Perception Analysis System Using Natural Language Processing and Attribute Control Charting\",\"subtitle\":\"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management\",\"date\":\"March 14, 2024\",\"description\":\"In this article, the CPAN (Customer Perception ANalysis) chart is developed, which will help the business owners to monitor the proportion of negative reviews on a temporal scale, augmented with the information on the most pervasive consumer grievances.\"},{\"title\":\"Education in AI Era: A Novel Approach to Enhance Learning and Development\",\"subtitle\":\"International Journal of Science, Engineering and Technology\",\"date\":\"July 1, 2022\",\"description\":\"In this paper, we have addressed some of the major challenges faced by students, teachers, and university management.
