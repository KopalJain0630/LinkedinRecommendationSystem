To combat these risks, researchers are experimenting with network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). However, data imbalance and high collection costs hinder effective machine learning (ML) model training. Our study addresses this by using 100% synthetic data generated via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for training NIDS ML models. This approach reduces dependency on real-world data, achieving high accuracy and performance across the UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, and BoT-IoT datasets, and demonstrating the potential of generative data in cybersecurity.\"},{\"title\":\"MobileNet-GRU fusion for optimizing diagnosis of yellow vein mosaic virus\",\"subtitle\":\"Ecological Informatics\",\"date\":\"March 2, 2024\",\"description\":\"Yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV) is a destructive plant virus that commonly affects crops, particularly okra, in India. The virus is transmitted by whiteflies and poses significant challenges to agricultural productivity. Infection with YVMV leads to distinct yellow vein patterns on leaves, stunted growth, reduced yield, and ultimately economic losses for farmers. Timely and accurate detection of YVMV is crucial for effective disease management. In this article, we present a novel method that employs advanced deep-learning models to identify YVMV-infected okra plants. The study leverages a dataset of over 2000 okra plant leaves that implements transfer learning models, including MobileNet, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 and recurrent neural networks (RNN) variants, including Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Gated recurrent unit (GRU). Additionally, three hybrid models, combining MobileNet with LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, are incorporated to capitalize on the characteristics of both MobileNet and RNNs through superior feature extraction and detection of temporal dependencies. The results demonstrate that the MobileNet model combined with all three RNNs achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing 99.27%. Notably, the MobileNet model integrated with GRU exhibits the most optimized performance with the least loss and greatest accuracy, facilitating improved disease management strategies and aiding in the yield of crops by reducing the impact of YVMV.\"},{\"title\":\"A Prognostic Framework for Post-Operative Patient Survival Prediction in IoMT\",\"subtitle\":\"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\",\"date\":\"February 16, 2024\",\"description\":\"The study presents an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework designed to predict patient survival outcomes through the evaluation of a post-thoracic surgery scenario. We employ a multi-layered IoMT framework that integrates various sensors and medical devices for real-time data collection, efficient data transmission, and data analysis. Utilizing a set of eight traditional and ensemble machine learning classifiers, along with neural networks optimized using grid search, we establish a baseline performance for the framework's capability in predicting post-surgical survival rates. However, as individual machine learning classifiers exhibit suboptimal performance across the performance metrics used, we combine the individual strengths of these classifiers to construct a stacking approach. The stacked classifier which incorporates a multi-layer perceptron as the final estimator achieved significant results, including a high accuracy of 0.90, precision of 0.87, and recall of 0.93. These metrics not only indicate a high post-operative survival detection rate but also demonstrate a balance of low bias and high variance performance, ensuring that the model is both accurate and reliable in varying IoMT scenarios.\"},{\"title\":\"Hyperparameter Optimization of Machine Learning Models for Monitoring Menstrual Mental Health\",\"subtitle\":\"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\",\"date\":\"September 29, 2023\",\"description\":\"Presented at IEEE inC4, this study uses text-mining to analyze women's sentiments during Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and menstrual cycles.
