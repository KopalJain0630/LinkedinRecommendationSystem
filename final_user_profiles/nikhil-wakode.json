Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The label associated with each record contains the letter R if the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder). The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.Click on the Link for further details\"},{\"title\":\"Spam Mail Prediction with Logistic Regression\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2022\",\"end_date\":\"Dec 2022\",\"description\":\"1.

For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.We also include gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.1.

As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.ContentColumnsage: age of the primary beneficiarysex: insurance contractor gender, female, malebmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependentssmoker: Smokingregion: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance1.
