Some of the key features that I contributed to included smart poles that could detect and report weather conditions and traffic data, interactive street lights that adjusted their brightness based on the proximity of vehicles, and an intelligent honking system that helped to reduce noise pollution. I also collaborated with a team to design and implement various other features, such as real-time accident detection and automated emergency response systems. Overall, this project enabled me to gain valuable experience in the fields of IoT, embedded systems, and intelligent transportation systems.\"},{}]",
