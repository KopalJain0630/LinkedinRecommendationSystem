Conventionallycorrosion margins are introduced to cope with the problems of corrosion and wear. Since the phenomena of corrosion and wear of structural hull members are the consequences of extremely complex processes governed by many factors, it is necessary to establish corrosion marginsand permissible corrosion levels by sufficiently taking into account the past records. This paper presents machine learning-based methods tomodel corrosion allowance in ships based on past data. It is seen that machine learning models can predict the level of corrosion for ships of a particular type (in the present work, bulk carrier) given the factors such as age, location, structural members' function, type of coating etc. Based on a comparative study using various learning algorithms like Neural Nets, Support Vectors, and Ensemble Learning, it is observed that corrosion can be predicted within acceptable range of accuracy for the selected ships.\"}]",
