It can be used to obtain a feasible prediction model but prior to model construction, the features that might influence the impact should be studied and the factors that can project the impact such as the diameter of the hole, the velocity of the particle prior to the collision, etc. The basic knowledge about the debris properties and its correlation with the materials is a must for any prediction technique to work.
