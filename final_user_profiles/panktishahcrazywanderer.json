However, in recent years, I went back to my roots. I started blogging in Gujarati. Soon enough, my native language started to flow through my pen like a river. Now, I find it therapeutic to write and speak in Gujarati, to express fully what I feel and think and it is a liberty like no other. Taking this new found love one step ahead, I have been blogging, vlogging and creating podcasts in Gujarati and these fill me with immense joy.\"},{\"title\":\"Travel Blogger\",\"subtitle\":\"Crazy Wanderer\",\"date\":\"January 1, 2015\",\"description\":\"When I am out of the office, I am busy solo traveling. I feel alive when I am in a place I have never been before, I feel a sense of belonging with strangers in towns that are full of cultural experiences, history and heritage, stories that are waiting to be told and that is why I travel. I write a travel blog where I share my experiences, tell the stories I collect from my expeditions and share them with the world. I am a solo traveler and I love to travel with myself, spend time getting to know who I am as a person. I have traveled across India, solo, and have also traveled 9 countries, with a longing to one day travel the entire world. As a solo traveler, my inclination is towards business and luxury travel as I prefer my leisure and comfort when I am on the go. My idea of fun is to have new experiences, try new and good food, experience decent infrastructure and experience temperate climate. I engage with my travel experiences professionally as well by doing blogging campaigns, Business and Luxury Travel - Collaboration and Consulting, I am a travel Instagrammer, as well as a freelance travel writer and social media strategist. It is a blessing to have my passion as my work so for me, it feels like the best of both worlds has come together.\"}]",
