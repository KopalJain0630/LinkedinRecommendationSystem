We split the work between front-end and back-end development.This took place during the pandemic, we successfully navigated working in a remote environment and used git for version control.Using a Kanban board we were able to keep track of tasks completed which led to a smooth and easy process to get the product completed before the hackathon deadline.Performed QA validation by running through several uses cases.Worked on creating good sales pitches to showcase the judges which lead us to reach top 12 teams all India.\"}]",
