Graph-based models underestimate the effective adjacent nodes by using signal-to-noise ratio measure instead of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio as suggested by polynomial fading models. A hybrid model is developed to accurately estimate the minimum number of schedules required for interference-free communication.\"}]",
