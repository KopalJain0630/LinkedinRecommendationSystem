The case has 4 broad learning objectives - 1) Understand how Balaji has transformed the TV content industry and what are the reasons behind its success in the TV industry. 2) Understand how to evaluate a firm's diversification moves using Porter's three tests: the attractiveness test, the cost-of-entry test and the better-off test. 3) Understand how the presence (or lack) of synergies between a firm's businesses can help (or constrain) a firm's diversification strategy. 4) Develop strategies for competing in the digital entertainment industry.\"}]",
