They like to explore other dances, languages, culture or they are willing to learn more so as to improve their own skills like joining writing classes or improving their communication skills or even seeking for some classes so as to crack examinations. With this willingness to know something new, there comes a need for various professional classes. Over the time, various different professional classes have come up offering courses from all around the world, but still there is a problem that is needed to be sorted out that is the knowledge about the existence of such classes is still not available that much. It's like these classes are there but still you cannot find them on the map. Most of these classes get their students on referral basis only and have zero or very less presence online. These classes may go for online marketing but they are not looking for students at that big scale and thus even their small online presence becomes useless. For the public, they remain unaware of any such classes in their nearby area and thus they also fail to learn something new. Comienzo will aim at providing an online platform to such classes where they can list themselves, and then the users may access that information so as to reach out to these classes. Information regarding the operating days and costs could be found out on the website. Comienzo will help bridge the marketing gap between classes and students.\"},{}]",
