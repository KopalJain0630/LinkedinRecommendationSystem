The video includes a video frame. The augmented reality application augments the video frame with an image of an item selected via input from a user device associated with a user. The augmented reality application determines, from the video frame, a score representing an action unit. The action unit represents a muscle on the face of the person depicted by the video frame and the score represents an intensity of the action unit. The augmented reality application calculates, from a predictive model and based on the score, an indicator of intent of the person depicted by the video.\"}]",
