The design goal of the application is to develop a light weight and high accuracy connection system for mobile phones. It leverages both the Ad-Hoc network and the Wi-Fi interface at the kernel-level of smartphones to achieve high connectivity. Each user's smartphone works autonomously as a connector for extending the reach. We implement and evaluated the complete application using commercial off-the-shelf smartphones. Our result shows that application can achieve connectivity upto a radius of 10 ft for more than 90% of the time for both indoor and outdoor environments.\"}]",
