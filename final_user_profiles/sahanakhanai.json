Focusing specifically on real-world credit card transactions, the initiative involves the collection, analysis, and processing of a credit card dataset. Leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, the project aims to accurately identify instances of fraudulent transactions. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, are employed to assess the performance of the techniques used. The project concludes with a notable achievement of approximately 99% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, signifying the potential efficacy of the applied methods in bolstering security measures against evolving fraud tactics."
