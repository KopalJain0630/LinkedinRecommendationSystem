And we usually ask questions about them like, “Why are they doing this to me?” Or, “Why are they acting so badly?” Best-Selling author and certified Behavior Change Specialist Bryan Falchuk asks, what if it’s not them, but you? He doesn’t mean you are the problem per se, but whether or not you’re the reason for the difficulty in the relationship, you can still be the reason for the solution. That idea is what he calls, “The 50 75 100 Solution,” which he teaches in this TEDx talk. Starting with three Buddhist principles, Falchuk goes on to explain how these can be used to see our control and influence over the majority of any relationship dynamic, and how recognizing and using that can lead the relationship to be 100% better.\"},{\"title\":\"Overcoming Challenges to Achieve Your Goals\",\"subtitle\":\"TEDx\",\"date\":\"March 20, 2018\",\"description\":\"TEDx Talk at Bergen Community College on March 6, 2018 on the idea of Do a Day and how you can live a better life everyday\"},{\"title\":\"The Simple 2-Step Process to Recovering from Burnout\",\"subtitle\":\"Inc.

The recognition that this is the single most important moment of truth for the customer is embedded across the industry and as such, the spotlight is on the claims process when customer experience is of paramount importance.Insurance and claims executives must transform the claims process, making it satis- fying to the consumer while also acting in the best interest of the insurer. The latter doesn’t mean denying liability or withholding payment by any means possible - quite the opposite.
