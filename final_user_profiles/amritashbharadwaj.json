The companies I analysed were Infosys (Core) and Tata Consultancy Services (Peer) - two giants in the IT sector. Final analysis showed that the companies have different risks despite working in the same sector and sub-sector. On an individual basis Infosys was less riskier than TCS. I also analysed the unlevered Beta ( beta at no or zero debt) for them. Here again TCS had a greater risk than Infosys in the past 1 year.The beta was calculated using the market movements in BSE Sensex and Nifty.\"},{\"title\":\"Changing Landscape of Employment in India (EY LLP)\",\"start_date\":\"May 2017\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2017\",\"description\":\" Macroeconomic and sector profiling with respect to job creation. Key emerging trends of job creation along with the causes/ influencers. For the focus sectors, establish the realignment of competencies and provide indicative employment numbers by newly defined sectors. Overall estimate of job creation over last 2-3 years across the jobs ecosystem (wage, casual, contractual, self/entrepreneurial). Estimation of job impact by select Government schemes like Mudra, Standup India, Skill India, etc. and Policy Recommendations.\"},{},{},{},{},{\"title\":\"Employment Elasticity\",\"start_date\":\"Feb 2017\",\"end_date\":\"May 2017\",\"description\":\" Estimated employment elasticity – both aggregate as well as sector specific - using a variety of approaches.
