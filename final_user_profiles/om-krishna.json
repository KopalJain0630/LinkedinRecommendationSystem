It's because since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyze the health of a patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lungs.In this detector I have used machine learning models like CNN and KNN model and after gathering my dataset, I was left with 50,000 total images, equally split with 25,000 images of COVID-19 positive X-rays and 25,000 images of healthy patient X-rays.The data is available on kaggle and after collecting the data I trained my model and after a continous effort and failing many times I succeed and was pretty shocked by the results when I got the accuracy of 100%.Till now it's the highest accuracy provider machine learning model which can easily detect Coronavirus infected person. The main advantage of this detector are : - Its a free software, Its time efficient that is it can provide the result within 5 seconds instead of 1day and for sure it can't remove the work of doctors but can make their work easy."
