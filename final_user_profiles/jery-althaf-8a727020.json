This model of rooftop solar panel based electricity generation provides a self-sustainable system for each household. Each household is thus independent of the main electricity grid and is self-sufficient in its energy needs. In rural areas of developing nations where significant population are devoid of electricity owing to location constraints and shortage of power sources, the SUN acts as a deity for their power needs. By adopting this model, empowerment at each village level independent of governmental support can be achieved leading to sustainable economic and social development.\"},{\"title\":\"CROWDSOURCING PLATFORM FOR APPROCHING HUMANITARIAN CHALLENGES\",\"subtitle\":\"IJ SocNet & Vircom\",\"date\":\"Dec 2012\",\"description\":\"Crowdsourcing describes a new Web-based business model that harnesses the creative solutions of a distributed network of individuals through what amounts to an open call for proposals.

Our aim is to make world better.We are asking ourselves:What is a future of entrepreneurship?How it will look like?What will be the trends in this area?Imagine that you are a young entrepreneur who wants to create a venture, or a venture capitalist who wants to invest in a specific business idea or country. What do you do? You think about business idea, you think about how to find financing, you think about experienced guys who could help with the advice and mentor you. One of the most important problems for all of them (mentor, entrepreneur, Vcapitalist, expert, business angel) is to find a right TEAM) - this is not just a words, but proved ones by many papers and researches.Many of us (not all) are living in the world of Social Networks (virtual and real ones), we use facebook, we use linkedin. Why? To solve our problems in our personal life (firstly) - necessity of communication or sharing experience or whatever, only then - for a work.What are main problems in entrepreneruship? There are many, and our project aims on solving them. The most important are:- to find a team,- to test, validate and prove hypothesis/business idea,- to find funding his is really hard and long process of decision making,- to develop and scale business model,- to get mentorship, advices from experienced entrepreneurs,- etc.What if we will create virtual community which will connect all these countries, people and roles, organizations and funds through the Global Startup Platform? It could have a lot of services and business models, but imagine that you could come and it will allow you to find right people in the right place at a right time and to solve your problem in the entrepreneurship in the most effective and efficient way?This is future of entrepreneurship!\"},{},{},{},{},{},{\"title\":\"INTELLIGENT INDUSTRIAL ROBOTIC ARM\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2010\",\"end_date\":\"Mar 2011\",\"description\":\"It can identify an object placed at any of the predefined place and transfer it to a desired placed by image processing\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"Electrification of village at Karukone\",\"start_date\":\"Jul 2010\",\"end_date\":\"Mar 2011\",\"description\":\"The project provided solar electrical solution to 7 houses in Karukone kollam district.The houses where inside the forest and 5km away from the grid.A team of 30 members from LINK successfully completed the project.I got the honor to be the Technical coordinator of the same\"},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]",
