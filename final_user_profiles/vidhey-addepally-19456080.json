Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be great if we could provide 2-wheelers with the important comforts of car like safety, comfort and protection? Sepal does exactly this! It is a revolutionary bike accessory designed by a group of IIT engineers to give riders complete control over their journey. Sepal is a collapsible roof that can be quickly attached to any motorcycle and it shall provide the riders with complete protection from Sun, rain dust and even cold, entirely on-demand. Also, it is integrated with electronics, handle buttons and a mobile app to provide the riders with all IOT comforts present in a car such as navigation, call alerts, music at their fingertips!!",
