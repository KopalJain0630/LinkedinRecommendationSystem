I led the project 'Suvidhaa' which aimed at providing livelihood to underprivileged women by creating a business model to support women and at the same time keeping sustainability at top. We conducted paper collection drives with the help of these women and provided the paper collected to NGOs so that they can recycle Paper and provide us with notebooks, These women were taught binding and cover designing with the help of experts, These notebooks were sold at Dilli Haat and shops to generate revenue, providing them with a steady source of income. We targeted 10 women and taught them about leadership, marketing and how to sustain the business in long run.",
