Depending on the frequency range of interest, prediction of vibro-acoustic behavior of a structure is usually done using the finite element method, boundary element method or through statistical energy analysis. The present study focuses on low frequency dynamic behavior of a composite payload fairing structure using both coupled and uncoupled vibro-acoustic finite element models up to 710 Hz. A vibro-acoustic model, characterizing the interaction between the fairing structure, air cavity, and satellite, is developed. The external sound pressure levels specified for the payload fairing’s acoustic test are considered as external loads for the analysis. Analysis methodology is validated by comparing the interior noise levels with those obtained from full scale Acoustic tests conducted in a reverberation chamber. The present approach has application in the design and optimization of acoustic control mechanisms at lower frequencies.\"},{\"title\":\"Design for random vibration- A case study\",\"subtitle\":\"Research Publishing Services, Singapore\",\"date\":\"June 14, 2016\"},{\"title\":\"Numerical estimation and experimental validation of structural response to random vibration\",\"subtitle\":\"Research Publishing Services, Singapore\",\"date\":\"June 14, 2016\"},{\"title\":\"An ultra-low frequency vibration isolation system for safe transportation of sensitive flight equipment\",\"subtitle\":\"Proceedings of The International conference on Fatigue, Durability and Fracture Mechanics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore\",\"date\":\"May 30, 2015\"},{\"title\":\"Random Vibration Fatigue of Launch Vehicle Structures\",\"subtitle\":\"Proceedings of The International conference on Fatigue, Durability and Fracture Mechanics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore\",\"date\":\"May 30, 2015\"},{\"title\":\"Wedge locking washers for aerospace applications\",\"subtitle\":\"Proceedings of Aeronautical society of India’s National Conference on Recent Trends in Aerospace Integration & Testing\",\"date\":\"April 15, 2015\"},{\"title\":\"“Design of launch vehicle secondary structures for random vibration\",\"subtitle\":\"Proceedings of Aeronautical society of India’s National conference on Aerospace structures technologies-Progress and outlook\",\"date\":\"June 14, 2014\"}]",
