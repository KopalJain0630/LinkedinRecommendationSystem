Optimization process for the mentioned objective in both of Open Pit and Underground mining was done on the economic block model. The applied Optimization Algorithms for Mining Limit determination extensively were studied. Because of the major difference between the shape and form ofmining limits in two main exploitation methods, implementation of the algorithms in searching and founding the mining limits for Open Pit and Underground is also different. Ataee-pour (1997) proposed the MVN algorithm to optimize stope boundaries using a three-dimensional fixed economic block model to locate the best neighbourhood of a block, which guarantees the mine geometry constraints. The neighbourhood concept is based on the number of mining blocks equivalent to the minimum step size. Since several neighbourhoods are available for each block, the one that provides the maximum net value is located for inclusion in the final stope. It can apply to any underground mining method, although it does not guarantee the true ‘optimum’ stope layout.\"}]",
