There were no sources of static surface water and the rocky subsurface environment made it very hard to sink wells. I evaluated the potential of harvesting water from a stream network originating in the nearby Himalayan foothills, charted streams, estimated flows, capacities and proposed a diversion based water supply system to be built from scratch.",
