The model then uses DIOA and workson the input data to predict whether the person is diseased or not and if diseased, thepart of the brain that might be affected.\"},{\"title\":\"Anomaly Detection in Network Activities\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Dec 2019\",\"description\":\"The proposed model sniffs network packets in real time and collects the number ofnetwork packets with respect to each protocol like TCP, IP, DNS etc. The model displaysthis data using live bar graphs, pie charts and time plots and uses this information todetect a DOS or DDOS attack.The research paper related to the above project has been submitted to IEEE and will bepublished shortly.\"},{\"title\":\"Winter Project at NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Dec 2019\",\"description\":\"Given the image of the dorsal view of a whale, I built a CNN model that identifies thespecies of the whale with more than 97% accuracy and got cerified by NVIDIA.\"},{\"title\":\"Image Recognition project\",\"start_date\":\"Oct 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Oct 2019\",\"description\":\"I used CNNs to analyse a large number of images of dogs and catsidentify a given image as that of dog or a cat.\"},{\"title\":\"Natural Language Processing Project\",\"start_date\":\"Aug 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Aug 2019\",\"description\":\"I used NLP to analyse a large number of restaurant reviews and identifywhether a given review is a positive one or a negative one.\"},{\"title\":\"Railway Reservations Project\",\"start_date\":\"May 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Jun 2019\",\"description\":\"I built a Railway Ticket Reservation System using Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C programing Language.\"},{\"title\":\"Python and Machine Learning project\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2018\",\"end_date\":\"Dec 2018\",\"description\":\"In the backend, I used various Linear Regression models to predict with more than 95%accuracy, the species of the an Iris flower given its dimensions. For the front end part, Ibuilt a GUI using Python so that they can compare the accuracy of the various modelsusing Bar Graphs and get the final prediction about the flower according to the mostaccurate model.\"}]",
