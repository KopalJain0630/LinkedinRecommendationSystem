This system utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the tone of the messages and comments, coupled with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable our algorithm to comprehend the potential meaning of the text. Moreover, our goal is to provide language support for all languages spoken in India, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\"},{\"title\":\"Chatter(AI chat bot)\",\"start_date\":\"Jan 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Mar 2020\",\"description\":\"\\\"Chatter\\\" is a chatbot implementation that leverages Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture. It incorporates a tokenization mechanism similar to BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) or WPM (WordPiece Model), which has been developed in-house. While the primary objective of this project is to create a robust NMT chatbot, it remains fully compatible with NMT and can be employed for sentence translations between two languages as well.\"},{\"title\":\"Mood Player\",\"start_date\":\"Jan 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Mar 2020\"},{\"title\":\"SEO calculator \",\"start_date\":\"Apr 2018\",\"end_date\":\"Apr 2018\",\"description\":\"This project is all about web crawling and basic python GUI with local search for static web pages.\"}]",
