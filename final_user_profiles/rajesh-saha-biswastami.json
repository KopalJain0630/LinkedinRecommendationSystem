To substantiate natural and environmental claims, the impacts of bio-based materials are typically quantified by applying life cycle assessment (LCA), as biomaterials have a lower impact in terms of human toxicity, terrestrial eco-toxicity, as well as carcinogenic potential. The aim of the article is to determine the different daily life performance of biomaterials mainly in the four-field, fields are biomedical, biopolymer, bio-fuel, and bio-product. Here, we provide an overview of key issues and methodologies explicitly pertinent to the LCA of biomaterials. Hence, the current article is focused on the methodology of different types of biomaterials and their application in our day to day life thoroughly discussed. In this book chapter, also focus on the future challenges and solution faced for successful application of biomaterials.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"\\\"Cosmic Microwave Background and What it Can Tell Us About Our Universe\\\".\",\"start_date\":\"Jul 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Feb 2020\",\"description\":\"As we all know that cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is the thermal /blackbody radiation emitted by the hot dense gas formed in the Big Bang. Cosmic background radiation oldest light in the universe therefore it's one of the most valuable tools to understand the universeâ€™s origins. In this paper, I review and described the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation along with the underlying theory and the implications of cosmology. I summarize all of these on the prospects for future progress. This discovery has established the Big Bang model of the Universe and the analysis of its fluctuations has confirmed the idea of inflation and led to the present era of precision cosmology. Also, I discuss the evolution of cosmological perturbations and their imprint on the CMB as temperature fluctuations and polarization. I also show how a phase of inflationary expansion generates fluctuations in the space-time curvature and primordial gravitational waves. In addition, I present findings of CMB experiments, from the earliest to the most recent ones. The accuracy of these experiments has helped us to estimate the parameters of the cosmological model with unprecedented precision so that in the future we shall be able to test not only cosmological models but General Relativity itself on cosmological scales.\"},{}]",
