Regulatory agencies in many countries mandate Serialization as a way of improving patient safety by identifying counterfeit medications. Drug manufacturers are therefore required to implement Serialization capabilities within their impacted manufacturing processes, the result being significant costs in operations. The company has adopted a decentralized approach which means Serialization capabilities are replicated at numerous plants. The Overall cost to implement Serialization is approximate $1.2M for the first line and $600K for each additional line within the same facility. The majority of the costs associated with Serialization implementation comes from the Hardware and software purchases. There are also reoccurring costs to maintain IT solutions lifecycle costs, which adds significantly to the overall plant overhead cost structure. The goal of our project is to conduct an evaluation/cost-benefit analysis of a proposed centralized approach to support company's operations which ultimately will help the company decide whether implementing such an approach will have any long term cost saving benefits.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"Evaluating the Global Operations Strategy for Accenture\",\"start_date\":\"Jun 2015\",\"description\":\"This was a short time bound project where we were evaluating the global operations strategy for Accenture, particularly its consulting leg. Our work included an environment and organization fit check, competitor analysis, global consulting performance and comparison and suggestions to optimize operation globally.Note: This was a dummy project and didn't require direct contact or association with the organization.\"},{},{},{},{},{\"title\":\"Operations Management\",\"start_date\":\"Nov 2014\",\"description\":\"In this project we analysed the operations strategy of the BMW company. The project essentially defines the organisation as a conversion process. It explores how the BMW company sets-up its operations and makes them coherent with their overall operations strategy. It defines the key aspects of directing, designing, managing and improving the operations systems which addresses an understanding of the operations function in a global context. The project provided a theoretical framework for thinking about operations in both manufacturing and service contexts of the organisation and recommended practical applications for its operations management.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"Analytical Support for Decision Making\",\"start_date\":\"Oct 2014\",\"description\":\"Achieved a high award for this project in the MBA program. The project examines the efficacy of the Primary, Secondary & Territory education system in Brazil over time impacting the growth of its economy and then makes recommendation to improve the system using world class benchmark standards for our client, The Education Minister of Brazil. We evaluate Brazil's education system by analyzing the World Bank data available to identify its progress over the last 30 years and then compare this data with other South American countries to understand the standard of progress in this region. The project then identifies a benchmark education system such as Switzerland, co-relates its economic growth with its efficacy in education system and then makes recommendation of such standards to the Education Minister of Brazil. The benchmark standard is identified by using statistical tools of collection, interpretation and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data to inform decision making for the Education Minister. The project pays close attention to the understanding and modelling of variability, uncertainty and risk and of multiple, conflicting priorities leading to identification of relationships in data, forming correlation with economic indicators and then making possible recommendations and forecasts to the education minister.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"Exploring the International Business Environment\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2014\",\"description\":\"A strategy based scenario building project carried out for our client \\\"Asian Development Bank\\\"​ in regards to the economic development operations in \\\"Developing Member Countries\\\" such as Kazakhstan. The project examines the countries contextual (or macro) environment ‘driving forces’, the large-scale fundamental forces in the environment and their causal and inter-relatedness that bring about change in the patterns and trends that we identified as underpinning observable events effecting the performance of the existing Millennium Development Goals in Kazakhstan. On the basis of such assumptions the projects makes prediction of various scenarios as an outcome in the future and makes necessary recommendations to the client to prepare for such uncertainties in the future. The time horizon used for this project was 2015 to 2030.\"},{},{},{},{},{}]",
