Although N-lauroyl-L-glutamate is reported inthe literature, the effect of the two carboxylate groups in it has not been specificallyaddressed. In this study, we report the interactions of bovine serumalbumin (BSA) with N-lauroylglutamate (S1) and an N-lauroyl derivative of atripeptide of glutamic acid (S2), respectively. The surfactant S1 has two andS2 has four carboxylic acid groups making them different from other Nlauroylamino acids, which have just one carboxylic acid group. The aim ofthis study is to understand the role of the number of carboxylate groups presentin these amino acid-based anionic surfactants while interacting with biomoleculessuch as BSA. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of thesurfactants were measured both in the presence and absence of BSA usingfluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence of BSA was quenched on additionof the surfactants. The mechanisms of fluorescence quenching wereestablished by studying the fluorescence at three different temperatures. CDstudies were performed to calculate the temperature at which BSA unfoldscompletely in the presence and absence of the surfactants. Conformationalchanges in the secondary structure of BSA were also observed on the additionof S1 and S2. The results of these studies are compared with those previouslyreported for the interactions between BSA and N-lauroylglycinate.We find that S1 has a lower CMC than S2 and lauroylglycinate. The surfactantS1 stabilized the secondary structure of BSA better at highertemperatures.\"},{\"title\":\"Enhancing Photocatalytic Attributes of Perovskite Nanocrystals in Aqueous Media via Ligand Engineering.\",\"subtitle\":\"ACS Appl.Mater.Interfaces\",\"date\":\"December 19, 2023\"},{\"title\":\"Enhanced Stability and Energy Transfer in Perovskite Nanocrystals: Paving the way for Moisture-Resistant Light-Harvesting Devices.\",\"subtitle\":\"ACS Applied Nano Materials\",\"date\":\"November 20, 2023\"},{\"title\":\"Design Principle of a Water-Dispersed Photocatalytic Perovskite through Ligand Deconstruction.\",\"subtitle\":\"ACS Energy Lett. 2023, 8, 5, 2159\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2168\",\"date\":\"April 12, 2023\"},{\"title\":\"Energy Funneling from Water-Dispersed Perovskites to Chromophores.\",\"subtitle\":\"ACS Energy Lett. 2023, 8, 1520\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1528\",\"date\":\"February 20, 2023\"}]",
