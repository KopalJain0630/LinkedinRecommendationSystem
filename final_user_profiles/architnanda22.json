In essence, it provides the features of a conventional e-bike without requiring any external energy whatsoever, thus being a very green solution.It can be retrofitted onto any regular bicycle, and significantly undercuts entry-level e-bikes in terms of cost while being superior in performance.https://youtu.be/ggDkIBrrtGkhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1e1t7mYiDQdeVoWw5ikmWRLRZiJvyvqyg/viewSmart System- Assisted in defining the need for product, mission and vision of the team through extensive research on existing products / technologies- Ideated and deployed the entire smart system from scratch - Researched the options and technologies available for smart system for the product based on principles like Regenerative braking and object detection through images - Conducted detailed research on the use of different types of sensors in Smart system and their viability for our product- Simulated the entire smart system & assisted in its integration with other subsystems- Analyzed the usage scenarios for Smart system and ideated on extreme situations and how that will impact the product- Participated in video and presentation making - Presented a functional animation of Smart subsystem in the product explanation video"
