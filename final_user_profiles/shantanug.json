Promoting less polluting non-oil based propulsion systems is an effective way to address these issues. Of all emerging road transportation technologies that use alternate fuel sources, Plugin Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are the closest to mainstream. India, with its high dependence on oil imports and having cities with some of the highest air pollution levels in the world, can benefit from large scale adoption of PEVs on its roads as the technology matures.\"}]",
