When individuals purchase goods and services from a participating business and then share them on social media a donation is made. To take the TAGG application a step further, the TAGG team dreamed of an additional service named CharityQ that could allow the businesses to easily process the donation requests being generated. This would free the decision makers and business owners to focus more on the business and still support the community by providing donations.This project included -1 Formal SoW2. Release planning3.

This process is carried out by IT Therapists who administer customized solutions to address very specific business problems. The IT Therapists administer these solutions through training, trust building, and technology implementation. The outcomes of these interventions are measured in terms of economic, social, and human development criteria. The training of IT Therapists began in 2006 with the IT for Development course offered in the College of IS&T (link). These IT Therapists became part of ETeams in 2007 when funding was secured for them through the NU Foundation. Since then additional funding sources have enabled a larger sample of small businesses to be served. Over 100 businesses have been part of this process since the start of this program. So far improvements have been measured in terms of administrative efficiency, access to new markets, and learning and labor productivity.This program trains micro-enterprise owners how to use information technology effectively by providing needs-based information systems training, technical assistance and operations and development services to micro-enterprises. Micro-enterprise owners gain the skills and knowledge necessary to use information technology to grow their businesses, and learn to access new customers and markets, achieve administrative efficiency, improve their businesses, and increase productivity. Current efforts have focused on highly customized interventions of technology, know-how, and guidance for individual micro enterprises. Students work on location with the micro-entrepreneurs to provide customized technology-based solutions to pressing business problems.\"},{\"title\":\"Information Technology for Development - Eteams\",\"start_date\":\"Aug 2017\",\"end_date\":\"May 2018\",\"description\":\"As a graduate assistant I was tied up with the Information Technology for Development - Eteams for given tenure.

This dataset was previously shared with researchers using an FTP server with no metadata and minimal search, query and retreival functions. To improve access to this dataset for NDOR and researchers nationwide, we have developed a set of programs for its curation and transition to a NSF DIBBS platform. Each file related to bridge health is also alinged and annotated with bridge inspection records submitted annually by NDOR to the National Bridge Inventory. This process requires converting the NDOR bridge management system directory structure to DataCenterHub directory structure.\"},{\"title\":\"Apartment Housing - CMS\",\"start_date\":\"Aug 2016\",\"end_date\":\"Dec 2016\",\"description\":\"This project is part of coursework management of software development utilizing agile methodology.
