We have found that static algorithms work better than dynamic algorithms for certain applications, so we have tried to combine features of dynamic load balancing with static to achieve optimum performance on various parameters. We propose this approach because it is easy to implement and its performance is very comparable to dynamic algorithms considering desirable features of both have been used to create the algorithm and minimize the drawbacks.\"}]",
