To realize this goal, the India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker was developed and launched. Three major national databases were harmonized to elicit reliable information related to the proportion of post-vaccination breakthrough infections and their association with the number of doses received and age-specific mortality trends. Here, we describe the efforts of establishing data synergies to develop the India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker for the public and policymakers.\"},{\"title\":\"COVID-19 in India: Epidemiological reflections from initial 170 million consecutive test results\",\"subtitle\":\"Frontiers\",\"date\":\"October 18, 2022\",\"description\":\"The report is a retrospective analysis of the testing data generated by the Indian Council of Medical Research.
