BBOC is a rotatory type furnace. Its key feature is to use a shrouded lance to inject oxygen through the bottom of the furnace, directly into the precious metals contained in the furnace, to oxidize base metals or other impurities as part of their removal as slag. BBOC product accounts for purity greater than 99.5%. Copper is the major impurity in BBOC casted anode and is around 7000-8000 ppm, which is totally undesirable. Impurity is directly linked with the processing time. Higher amounts of impurities increase the processing time. Lead (Pb), on the other hand, is added to oxidize copper and decrease its concentration from silver bullion but due to reverse reactions, lead is retained in the melt creating another impurity in the casted anode. The main aim of this project was to improve certain process parameters and to standardize the techniques involved in the operation of BBOC so as to eliminate the desired impurities. Also, this project focuses on increasing the purity content of BBOC anode which will eventually decrease the cycle time of Hydro-section\"},{\"title\":\"Reduction of spent anode of electrolytic cell in hydro section by 50%\",\"start_date\":\"May 2018\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2018\",\"description\":\"Bottom Blown Oxygen Cupel (BBOC) was developed by the staff at Britannia Refined Metals Limited (BRM), a British subsidiary of MIM Holdings Limited (which is now part of the Glencore group of companies). After BBOC casting, anodes are brought to hydro section and charged in 8 dedicated cells filled with AgNO3 electrolyte. Anodes are hanged on copper bus bars via hook and are placed one after the other. Each cell is charged with 50 anodes and each anode weighs around 12 kilograms. Hence, each cell is charged with 600 kilograms of anode. An average batch cycle of these cells lasts up to 36-40 hours. After each batch, fine silver powder is scrapped off and is sent for ingot casting. This project is primarily focused on reduction of spent anode from the electrolytic cell by 50%. Several parameters were investigated to control the spent anode production. This work not only reduces the production of spent anode but enhances the overall efficiency of the plant. Spent anode production is the major problem in hydro section and reducing it will increase the first pass production of the plant.\"},{\"title\":\"Optimizing Cycle Time in Tempering Of Crown Wheel\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2017\",\"end_date\":\"Jan 2018\",\"description\":\"This project focuses on optimizing the correct cycle time which can reduce the cycle time for the tempering process up to 135 minutes. Tempering is a heat treatment process which is done to relieve extra stresses generated in the crown wheel after quenching. The previous cycle time for tempering was 150 minutes but with the efforts taken in the project, the cycle time was optimized for up to 135 minutes.\"}]",
