To solve this problem, we designed a web service which will aid in direct farmer-to-farmer and farmer-to-supplier communication so as to make a fruitful community and better service support which will lead to greater profitability for all farmers. Some of the common problems we aim to resolve are the availability of good quality seeds, pesticides and fertilizers, small landholdings, and lack of mechanization.SOLUTION:We propose a web service with a website which will provide the following features:1. A login option for farmers, retailers, and wholesalers, suppliers and service providers for inter-communication between different communities.2. Advertisements for offers can be published on the website and can be notified to farmers through SMS.3. Chat service for inter-community communication.4. A reviewing and complaining system for farmers for better selection and quality check of products.5. We provided them with live data for the government declared selling price of the crop in their region.6. We also provided then with live weather data and weather forecast to help them in decision making.CONCLUSION:Our web service will give the farmers a platform to share their grievances and get helpful feedback form others who are facing or have faced a similar problem. This can help them to increase their efficiency and get a better value of their products."
