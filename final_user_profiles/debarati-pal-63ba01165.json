    "about": "I'm working as a materials scientist at Shell Technology Centre, Bangalore, where I drive innovation in solving corrosion issues in the oil and gas industry. My work focuses on materials selection, qualification, and providing recommendations, I worked on some R&D projects such as electrochemistry and battery technology. Previously, I worked on solar-thermoelectric generators and hydrogen evolution cathode materials at Nordische Technology. My Ph.D. research delved into the electronic and magnetic properties of topological single crystal materials, including Topological Insulators and Weyl Semimetals. My skill set includes X-ray diffraction, Physical Property Measurement System, Magnetic Property Measurement System, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, tunneling electron microscopy, and computational simulations with medeA-VASP software. In my current role, I am deeply engaged in addressing corrosion-related challenges, conducting failure analysis, and advancing the use of GRE nonmetallic pipelines, CRA qualification for well materials, and CUI coatings for assets.",
