The motive behind making this platform was to provide a structure to this unorganized sector. It is a software solution designed to assist brands with their Influencer Marketing Campaigns. Influencer Marketing Platforms provide influencer discovery tools for brands and agencies, some also offer massive searchable databases of potential influencers, using clever algorithms. Brands begin by creating and defining their campaign, being as specific and detailed as possible. They then search for influencers. With the Self-Serve plan, the search runs very much like any other influencer marketplace. Creators can pitch to brands directly for their campaigns by offering their respective gigs.\"},{},{},{},{\"title\":\"UI/UX Design of a Digital Detox App\",\"start_date\":\"Mar 2021\",\"end_date\":\"Mar 2021\",\"description\":\"This app promotes digital minimalism by stimulating the power of decision making of an individual.

We know that the same name can be spelt out in many ways (for example, Marc and Mark, or Elizabeth and Elisabeth). Therefore, sound can be a better way to match names than spelling. In this project, I have used the Python package Fuzzy to find out the genders of authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picturebooks.First, using fuzzy (sound) name matching, I have searched for author names in a dataset provided by the US Social Security Administration that contains names and genders of all individuals who have applied for Social Security Cards(the dataset). And then aggregate the author dataset by including gender. Finally, I plotted the gender distribution of children's picture books authors over time.\"},{\"title\":\"The Hottest topics in Machine Learning\",\"start_date\":\"Nov 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Nov 2020\",\"description\":\"Used Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.\"},{\"title\":\"University Admission Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression\",\"start_date\":\"Oct 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Oct 2020\"},{\"title\":\"Twitter sentiment analysis\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Oct 2020\",\"description\":\"Using Natural Language Processing techniques, sentiment analysis of twitter tweets was done, i,e. the model tests whether the tweets are positive or negative.
