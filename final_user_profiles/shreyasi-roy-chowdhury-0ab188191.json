This  facilitated inclusion of static rank, a popularity signal to the ranker, taken up by other team members. - Designed a stable metric based on discounted cumulative gain (DCG) score to analyse Bing Shopping results based on offer relevance to query, quality of offers, and savings aspects. -Automated the relevance quality measurement pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges by prompt engineering the judgement guidelines for model input. This approach proved to be 60% cost effective while increasing the throughput by almost 10x-Analysed market-wise relevance-based DCG scores for Bing vs. Google Shopping for a fixed queryset. Tagged queries for categories using LLM, enabling slicing and dicing of data for further analysis. Created a monitoring dashboard for score comparison.- Analysed DST (dynalic shop tab) triggering and suppression, in order to find the reason behind a sudden volume drop for Shop tab in a specific time-period. Analysed Coverage, FSDAU and FCDAU, precision and recall of DST triggering, and suprresion by other verticals to reach to a possible conclusion. Created monitoring dashboard for future use, facilitating easy debugging for any future volume drop scenario.",

Studied about DICOM data standard and Pydicom library, a python package for medical images, and radiotherapy objects.Extracted features from the CBCT images using Pydicom library and found feature importance using T-test.Used classification algorithms like RandomForest to find whether a patient is responding to chemotherapy.\"},{\"title\":\"Introducing interpretability in convolutional neural network\",\"start_date\":\"Oct 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Dec 2020\",\"description\":\"Did literature review of research papers like ‚ÄùInterpretable Convolutional Neural Networks‚Äù and \\\"This Looks Like That: Deep Learning for Interpretable Image Recognition‚Äù.Implemented their codes to compared how introducing interpretability with Convolutional Neural Networks gave better performance than gradient-based visualization techniques like Grad-CAM.\"},{\"title\":\"Prediction of crop production using image processing\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Feb 2020\",\"description\":\"Used different types of segmentation to find out the percentage of green vegetation in the given images. Used semantic, edge-based and region-based segmentation to find the percentage of green and yellow vegetation cover.\"}]",
