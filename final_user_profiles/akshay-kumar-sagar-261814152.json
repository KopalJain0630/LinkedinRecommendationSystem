Sensor is used for finding the distance of the Train at a fixed distance . These sensor is placedso that whenever a train passes it, Sensor Generate a low signal pulse that is received by the microcontroller, passesto the Circuit which give us the information about the train and close or open the railway crossing.\"}]",
