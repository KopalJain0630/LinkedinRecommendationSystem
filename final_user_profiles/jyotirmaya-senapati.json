Poachers Turned in to Protectors: A case Study On Community Based Ecotourism at Mangalajodi Odisha. International Journal of Economics and Management Science, 3(1), 88-98. ISSN: 2229-4430.Erstwhile local communities of Mangalajodi of Khordha district, Odisha were making their living mostly by catching fishes from the Chilika Lake at Mangalajodi and by illegal poaching of migratory birds. As time passed by, large scale poaching activities resulted in ecological imbalance, biodiversity degradation and with a lot more negative impacts gradually started becoming ardent threat for the future of biodiversity at this Birds Paradise. The alarming scenario gets a kind of rejuvenation with the introduction of ecotourism and related activities at Mangalajodi. This initiation employs almost 100 families of the nearby villages. The poachers eventually turned into protectors of biodiversity. This exploratory research focuses on the process of development of ecotourism at Mangalajodi in a sustainable manner with the participation of various stakeholders such as local communities, Mangalajodi Ecotourism Trust (MET), NGOs like; Indian Grameen Services (IGS), Corporate house like; RBS Foundation India (RBSFI), travel operators, government organizations, tourists etc. at various level. Another major aspect is to figure out various socioeconomic, environmental and other key driving factors influencing local residents in such a remarkable transformation from destructor of the environment to get involved in ecotourism activities. The existing challenges for the sustainable development of community based ecotourism at the destination have also been attempted to hit upon.\"}]",
