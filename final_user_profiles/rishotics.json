Given the recent deep learning revolution, there has been much attention in using deep learning models for time series prediction, and hence it is important to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present an evaluation study that compares the performance of deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction. Our deep learning methods compromise of simple recurrent neural networks, long short term memory (LSTM) networks, bidirectional LSTM, encoder-decoder LSTM networks, and convolutional neural networks. We also provide comparison with simple neural networks use stochastic gradient descent and adaptive gradient method (Adam) for training. We focus on univariate and multi-step-ahead prediction from benchmark time series datasets and compare with results from from the literature. The results show that bidirectional and encoder-decoder LSTM provide the best performance in accuracy for the given time series problems with different properties.\"},{\"title\":\"Delhi air quality prediction using LSTM deep learning models with a focus on COVID-19 lockdown\",\"subtitle\":\"arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.10551\",\"date\":\"January 24, 2021\",\"description\":\"Air pollution has a wide range of implications on agriculture, economy, road accidents, and health. In this paper, we use novel deep learning methods for short-term (multi-step-ahead) air-quality prediction in selected parts of Delhi, India. Our deep learning methods comprise of long short-term memory (LSTM) network models which also include some recent versions such as bidirectional-LSTM and encoder-decoder LSTM models. We use a multivariate time series approach that attempts to predict air quality for 10 prediction horizons covering total of 80 hours and provide a long-term (one month ahead) forecast with uncertainties quantified. Our results show that the multivariate bidirectional-LSTM model provides best predictions despite COVID-19 impact on the air-quality during full and partial lockdown periods. The effect of COVID-19 on the air quality has been significant during full lockdown; however, there was unprecedented growth of poor air quality afterwards.\"},{\"title\":\"A Proposal of FPGA-based Low Cost and Power Efficient Autonomous Fruit Harvester\",\"subtitle\":\"6th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR 2020)\",\"date\":\"Apr 2020\",\"description\":\"The significant contribution of our work is:-• Development of a power-efficient bot which is enabled by FPGA, a low-power embedded system which shows an optimization in both power consumption and performance in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) applications.• The biggest challenges for the cost-effective robotic-fruit plucker are detection, i.e. determining the location of each fruit and detaching them from the plant without harming the plant in the absence of costly sensors and processing unit.• We demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for fruit, a 3D localization, and a grasp selection method.\"},{\"title\":\"Deep reinforcement learning for variability prediction in latent heat flux from low-cost meteorological parameters\",\"subtitle\":\"Optics and Photonics for Advanced Dimensional Metrology, International Society for Optics and Photonics\",\"date\":\"Mar 2020\",\"description\":\"Predicting cropland latent heat flux (LHF) from commonly measured low-cost meteorological parameters (MPs) like net solar radiation, soil and air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, and canopy temperature of the crops is essential for modeling crop production and managing water resources economically. In this treatise, we explore the deep reinforcement learning framework for short-term LHF trend estimation from the above MPs. The problem is reformulated as a classification problem, where each MP is acquired for a cost, and the objective is to optimize the trade-off between the predicted trend error and the relative MP acquisition cost. A sequential trend forecasting problem is evaluated via Q-learning with a linear guesstimate and a deep Q-learning scheme via neural network, where the distinct actions are the individual request for the MP values, and each episode is terminated by anticipating a trend. The proposed methodology is validated on the acquired farm-data, collected from the field experiments conducted on the cropland monitoring sites at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya State Agricultural University, Kalyani, West Bengal, India. The three non-rice crops, namely the yellow Sarson (mustard), potato, and green-gram, are studied owing to their similar energy balance partitioning patterns.\"}]",
