FIne tuned Google's BERT to extract features and used transfer learning to train a classifier on top of those extracted features. Used NB-SVM as baseline model. Further working on explainability of the model and predicting things around a given context using sliding window techiniques. Trained a new language model from scratch (Multiplicative LSTM). Used brat as annotation tool for collecting training data.\"},{\"title\":\"Automatic Scheduler (Artificial Intelligence)\",\"description\":\"Scheduled different conference talks and audits timings minimizing the clash between different events as far as possible using best first search technique of artificial intelligence.\"},{\"title\":\"Cloud Computing ( Module design for live migration using a migration plan and virsh commands)\",\"description\":\"Proposed a migration plan that takes into account 3 parameters namely network traffic, memory usage and CPU usage.
