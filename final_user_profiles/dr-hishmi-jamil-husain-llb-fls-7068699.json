To meet future energy demand it has recognized by scientist that something has to be done for the large global population of about 2 billion people live below the poverty line, whose needs have to be addressed on priority basis, so that they are not marginalized further due to globalization of economy and unequal sharing of resources and wealth. \"},{\"title\":\"Weed to Wealth: Use of Lantana in Furniture Making in India\",\"subtitle\":\"Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy,IUCN, Gland, Switzerland\",\"date\":\"October 5, 2015\",\"description\":\"Lantana camara is infamous weed shrub spread to more than 50 countries as an invasive species. Lantana is a nuisance in the forest, agriculture lands and pasture lands. This rapidly growing weed is a threat to the biodiversity of any region because it grows very fast and covers open ground very quickly so it hinders the regeneration of species. Lantana often out-competes other important species, leading to a reduction in biodiversity. \"},{\"title\":\"Delhi Air Quality Challenges & Action Plan\",\"subtitle\":\"Vivekananda International Foundation\",\"date\":\"August 26, 2015\",\"description\":\"The ambient air quality has been monitored in Delhi since 1984 by the Central Pollution Control Board formerly known Delhi Pollution Control Committee.

India is one of the vulnerable countries when it comes to effects of global warming due to its vast coastal line and the rising sea levels caused by global warming. There are several factors which are contributing to climate change it is not only the Green House Gas (GHG) emission so putting all control on GHGs emission is not going to help us in controlling the climate change.\"},{\"title\":\"Safe zones bring a new life to Indian vultures\",\"subtitle\":\"IUCN Commission on Education and Communication. Gland, Switzerland\",\"date\":\"December 16, 2014\",\"description\":\"Vultures are a critical part of the food chain because they maintain a balanced ecosystem and prevent the unnecessary spread of disease. The dramatic decline in the Indian vulture population is directly linked to animal husbandry practices, namely the use of the pain killer, Diclophenac, to treat cattle. This pain killer poisons the vultures when they eat the carcasses of cattle. Today almost 99% of the vulture species in India has been eradicated.\"},{\"title\":\"Sustainable Development and Analysis of People’s Participation with reference to Joint Forest Management in India,\",\"subtitle\":\"African Asian J.

Scientific investigation may be helpful inimproving and regenerating degraded hills byprotection of slopes through raising vegetationsuited to parent material and soil. Soils areconsidered to be our basic treasure. Man is dependenton soil and productive soil depends on man. Each ofthe different kinds of soils requires specialmanagement practice which changes from season toseason. The knowledge of mineralogical behavior ofsoils at good natural sites and at degraded sitesopens at possibilities of optimal management inputsto augment production of the biomass from good siteas well as from degraded site after suitableamelioration. In the present intensified programme ofraising large scale plantation, especially of fastgrowing species, the fertility potential dependslargely on the mineralogical composition of the soil.The underlying parent material plays a vital role indetermining the success or other-wise of theplantations especially over a number of rotations ina given year.

The vulnerability is generated on the cost of benefits to other. Though many agencies, institutes, organizations, states and countries are still trying to provide such suitable policy frame work in which the security for the entitlements of these vulnerable groups must be maximum. The two hydroelectric projects viz., Narmada and Tehri hydroelectric project's affected population and the resettlement and rehabilitation policy for these two vulnerable groups provide some scope to implement and add new paradigm for the resettlement and rehabilitation policy for these vulnerable groups.
