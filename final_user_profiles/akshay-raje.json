I wanted to investigate how do chemical companies make their products more circular and then dive deeper into the role Corporate Venture Capital plays in incubating, investing or acquiring external entities for closing the loop. For gathering insights, I spoke to multiple stakeholders, including CEOs, Sr. Managers, and Consultants at CVCs and Sustainability consulting to understand how the industry is grabbing this opportunity. The European Chemical industry is at crossroads, faced with tough competition externally and regulations internally. My hypothesis was that this vehicle of CVC would be a crucial tool in building competitiveness. The thesis discusses the insights gathered from the interviews, some pertinent case studies and suggests a framework for using CVC to further sustainability and closing the loop.\"},{\"title\":\"Green Banking Initiative: Paving the Path to Sustainability at Caisse De'Epargne Cote d'Azur\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2023\",\"end_date\":\"Jan 2024\",\"description\":\"As a part of the Sustainability Impact Challenge during the MBA, we worked with a French multinational bank to develop policies and products for their aim of becoming greener. Over the course of 4 months, we worked with the clients and stakeholders in French, to fulfil their goal of helping all their stakeholders- employees, shareholders, and customers to be more green. Through intense data collection, ideation, external research, and user testing, we developed two solutions: One, a plan for an employee engagement initiative for making them more sustainability oriented and another, a product of 'Green products consulting' for getting their shareholders and customers to make more green investments. The solutions were well received by the board of the bank and they are already in process to implement them internally.\"},{\"title\":\"Strategic Expansion Blueprint: ACS Clothing's entry into the European market\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2023\",\"end_date\":\"Nov 2023\",\"description\":\"As a part of our Strategic Marketing class, we worked with ACS Clothing, a Scotland based circular clothing company for their Europe expansion plan. Our team developed a comprehensive business entry plan for them, to successfully penetrate the European market. Our strategy includes market analysis, competitive positioning, logistical planning, and targeted marketing initiatives to ensure a smooth and impactful expansion. By leveraging ACS Clothing's unique value propositions and aligning with local consumer preferences, we made a plan for them to establish a strong foothold in Europe and drive sustainable growth.\"}]",
