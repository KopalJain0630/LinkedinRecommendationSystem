The Pairs Trading, one of the techniques of statistical arbitrage, is a market neutral trading strategy. The daily future prices of stocks traded and listed on NSE are used on rolling basis to compute the performance based on the selection of pairs through minimizing the sum of squared deviation (distance method) and the selection based on cointegration tests (cointegration method) for identifying stocks suited for pairs trading strategies. To examine the risk of pairs trading and the drivers of returns, the portfolio returns are risk-adjusted using Fama and French three factor asset pricing model.\"},{\"title\":\"Risk Measurement: An Introduction to Value-at-Risk (VaR)\",\"subtitle\":\"National Press Associates\",\"date\":\"February 15, 2020\",\"description\":\"Value at risk (VaR) has been called the \\\"new science of risk management\\\", which calculates the maximum loss expected (or worst case scenario) on an investment, over a given time period and given a specified degree of confidence. Losses greater than the VaR are suffered only with a specified small probability. This paper is an introduction to the concept and methodology of VaR. We explain the concept of VaR, and then describe three methods for computing it.\"}]",
