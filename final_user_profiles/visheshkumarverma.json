The present study was aimed at designing a bio-retention filter basin in Kharghar node of Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The analysis was carried out for both minor (5-year average recurrence interval) and major (100-year average recurrence interval) floods. Total discharge was computed using the rational formula and it was estimated as 0.023 m3/s for minor flood condition and as 0.037 m3/s for major flood condition. The maximum infiltration rate was computed as 0.0047 m3/s considering sandy loam soil as the filter media. A flow width of 1.6 m was considered in designing the bio-retention filter. 100 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride pipe was proposed as they are the best in terms of performance and have advantage over other pipes. No liner is required for filter according to the soil condition of Kharghar. A transition layer of 100 mm gravel was suggested to provide better efficiency and durability for the bio retention system. The vegetation for the bio-retention basin can be Doob or Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) as it has the highest water retention capacity as per Indian conditions.\"},{\"title\":\"Design of Bio-retention Filter Basin for Conservation and Purification of Storm water runoff in Urban Areas\",\"subtitle\":\"International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering.\",\"date\":\"December 14, 2020\",\"description\":\"Research Paper published in International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering.Link:https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v9i4/D5011119420.pdfABSTRACTUrban areas are more susceptible to water loggingand subsequent flood conditions because of reduced rate ofinfiltration arising from construction activities particularlyduring the monsoon season. However, if the storm water runoff isconserved and purified, it will be useful to cater to the needs of thehuge population in urban areas during the periods of less rainfallor non-monsoon season. Bio-retention basins are bestmanagement practices that use a biogeochemical process within avegetative eco-system to provide soil moisture retention andpurification of storm water. While this structure has beenimplemented in many countries around the world, it is yet to beimplemented in Indian cities with necessary modificationsconsidering the topography, population pressure, hydrologicalcharacteristics of a basin, and the soil and water managementpractices.

Sangita Mishra(Associate Professor),Vishesh Verma, Divya Sakharle, Kashif Ansari Amity School of Engineering and Technology, Amity University Mumbai Page No: 184-190 DOI:16.10089.CEJ.2020.V11I6.285311.3108ABSTRACTDrought is a recurrent climatic hazard and a major threat to livelihood and socioeconomic development of people. The Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra state has been reeling under frequent drought conditions due to incessant rainfall, dry dams and over-exploitation of groundwater. Thisstudy is aimed to identify type of drought events, estimation of drought severity, duration and spatial and temporal extension of drought to enforce mitigation measures for farmers in the Ahmednagar, Aurangabad and Latur districts of Maharashtra. From the analysis of rainfall for a period of (1930-2001), it was observed that minimum rainfall varied from 355 mm- 400 mm while the maximum rainfall varied from 1042 mm – 1158 mm in all three districts for the period under observation. The average annual rainfall varied from 694 mm – 836 mm and more than 50% of the years had witnessed below average rainfall in all the three districts. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used as the drought severity indicator in this study and the characteristics of droughts were examined for the period from 1930 to 2001. Drought conditions with varied intensity were observed in almost all the years with highest intensity of -2.67 in the Ahmednagar district. Severe and extreme droughts were experienced from time to time across all the three districts that has lead to adverse results on agricultural practices and water resources.\"}]",
