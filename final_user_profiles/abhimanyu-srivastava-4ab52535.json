A circuit was made using basic analog components that would allow us to adjust the initial conditions and constants. The circuit could successfully mimic the attractor's characteristics. The attractor represents the behavior of gas at any given time.and could be used in weather forecast systems. This also finds applications in fields like data encoding and information security.\"},{}]",
