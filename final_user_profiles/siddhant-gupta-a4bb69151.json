The structural design entailed powerplant loading analysis, generating the structural layout in CATIA and performing detailed analysis to prevent failure due to bending, buckling or shear. The design was revised through Finite Element Analysis and Fatigue Analysis.- Successfully presented the design in a Critical Design Review amongst experts from Airbus, Rolls Royce, BAE Systems and the RAF.",

Conducted a parametric study of the maximum flow-enhancement of the free-stream, and the convection coefficient with the electrode spacing, applied voltage and the ambient pressure.- Observed a rise in flow speed and total heat transfer with voltage at constant spacing and ambient pressure. Verified the possibility of an optimal distance of the plate from the wire. Established a linear relation between the convection coefficient and the fourth root of displacement current. Proposed methods to reduce loss in heat transfer at lower ambient pressures.",

            "description": "- This team project focused on expanding on the concept of a mid-size business jet, including defining basic performance requirements like range (5000km), cruise Mach number (0.85), cruise altitude (40000ft) and design payload (1500kg). These requirements helped in performing trade studies to estimate the weight, wing and tailplane parameters, control surface dimensions and quantities including specific thrust and wing loading.- This was followed by creation of a CAD model of the jet, conducting aerodynamic analysis through CFD for obtaining aerodynamic force and moment characteristics and construction of n-V diagrams for maneuver and gust cases.- The project concluded with location of center of gravity and longitudinal and lateral stability analysis for the aircraft."
