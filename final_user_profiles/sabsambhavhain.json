A direct consequence of this is that not all parts of a video are equally popular. Motivated by this, we explore the benefits of dividing files into smaller segments for caching. We treat incoming requests as requests for segments of files and propose a Markovian request model which captures the time-correlation in requests. We characterize the fundamental limit on the performance of caching policies which only cache full files. Next, we propose and analyze the performance of policies which cache partial files. Using this, we characterize the potential for improvement in performance due to caching partial files and analyze its dependence on various system parameters like cache size and the popularity profile of the files being cached\"},{\"title\":\"Author: Memory Aids for Chemistry\",\"description\":\"A book of mnemonics, tricks & facts for competitive chemistry, Featured in Nav Bhart Times (NBT)\u00ef\u201a\u00a7Identified need for competitive chemistry training in tier 2 cities; first mover into the segment \u00ef\u201a\u00a7Sold 8000+ copies in 5 cities, grossing INR 400K revenue; undertook yearlong research process\"},{\"title\":\"Personal Blog \"}]",
