Preprocessed the data using correlation coefficient to identify highly correlated attributes and remove the redundant ones to reduce attributes and used Inter-quartile range to remove the outliers from the data. Generated new relevant feature attributes from given attributes and used Z Score normalization to transform the data. Visualized the data using correlation heat map, box plots, bar graphs and line charts to analyze the historic production of various crops. Implemented 4 regression models - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, KNN- Regression & SVM Regression to predict crop production in following scenarios:1) Predicting overall crop production of particular crop in India in a year 2) Predicting production of a particular crop in a particular season3) Predicting production of a particular crop in a particular state4) Predicting production of a particular crop in a particular state in a particular seasonAnalyzed the prediction accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) & Explained Variance Score. RESULTS: Overall, linear Regression outperformed other algorithms and had better prediction results in all the cases. Secondly, both the metrics gave similar results or ranked the algorithm in similar manner in most of the cases. Training data had decent accuracy in each case without much variation for all the cases.A general trend can also be observed that as we keep on specifying a greater number of attributes the prediction accuracy on validation set also increases.\"},{\"title\":\"Impact of different flexible flaps on power and lift of rotary blades\",\"start_date\":\"May 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2019\",\"description\":\"OBJECTIVE: Measure the flexural rigidity of 4 samples and study the effect of lift and power when used as flaps in the rotary bladesSTRATEGY: Calculated deflection using line loads and find Youngâ€™s Modulus using narrow beam theory approximation for each sample. Load Cell was used to measure the force and IR Speed Sensor was used to measure the RPM speed of rotary blades. Lift and Power was measured at 800 RPM for samples from force components & formula for spanwise and chordwise casesRESULTS: The sample with maximum rigidity produced 50% more lift at 25% more power when attached Chordwise to the blades. The sample with maximum rigidity was most efficient compared to baseline blade when attached spanwise to the blades\"}]",
