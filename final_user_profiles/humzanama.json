The same may be said for Virtual Reality Devices utilized in virtual reality environments. The current study focuses on various human factors related issues (bodily discomforts), immersiveness in relation to Virtual Reality Devices (Cardboard devices, Open devices, Closed devices), duration, and different VR Interfaces. A between-group study was conducted on 90 users who were provided with three different types of virtual reality devices and three distinct game interfaces to play on each device. The findings from this studyâ€™s statistical data will aid in the development of improved VR devices in the near future. It will also help to reduce the current human factors-related issues associated with VR devices as well as throw light on the immersiveness due to type of devices and duration of usage of VR devices. Practical Implications: This paper unfolds VR related eye sicknesses and interface design related issues causing eye sicknesses. A human factors guideline can be developed based on findings of the current study. The VR game interfaces can be evaluated using similar study protocol.
