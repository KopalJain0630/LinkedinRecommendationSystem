The conducted experiments show that our implementation has strong scalability with increasing matrix size enabling us to multiply large matrices with upto 21% less wall clock time than MLLib, the in-built matrix multiplication implementation in Spark.\"},{\"title\":\"On Distributed Solution for Simultaneous Linear Symmetric Systems\",\"subtitle\":\"2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)\",\"date\":\"December 13, 2020\",\"description\":\"In this paper, we present two distributed block-recursive approaches to solve large SPD (Symmetric and Positive Definite) systems - the symmetric version of the state-of-the-art Strassen's algorithm and Cholesky based inversion algorithm. We show experimentally that both the approaches have good scalability and Cholesky based approach is more efficient as it uses fewer matrix multiplications in each recursion level than Strassen based algorithm.\"}]",
