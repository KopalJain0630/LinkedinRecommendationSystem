The paper establishes relationships between performance and other factors, the factors affecting expense ratio and the comparative analysis of funds with benchmark performance. The major focus area of the study is to help investors by making them know about the factors affecting the mutual funds returns and another investment alternative novice investor i.e., benchmark investing as a lot of active mutual funds are unable to beat the benchmarks. The mutual funds data is taken from varied secondary sources like Money control, Morningstar, Paytm money, AMFI website and many more. Statistical analysis on the data is done by using varied tools like correlation, regression, t test and descriptive statistics. The risk and the expense ratio have significant impact on funds’ performance. It is also found that expense ratios are affected by the size and age of fund. Lastly, it is found that the active mutual funds didn’t beat the benchmark returns on average.\"},{\"title\":\"Arbitrage Funds: An alternative to Fixed deposits?\",\"subtitle\":\"Budding Analyst\",\"date\":\"June 17, 2020\",\"description\":\"This comprehensive article was also selected as the best article of the month.\"}]",
