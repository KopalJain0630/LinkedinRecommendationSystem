Given the specifications of a finite-state machine A and its circuit implementation B, the goal of CC is to verify the correctness of B. Conformance checking is a hard problem; typically, various formal methods, simulation techniques, and meta-heuristics are employed to resolve it. However, even for moderate-size FSMs, these approaches either become computationally unmanageable or are unable to provide adequate error coverage. In this work, we train a deep neural network (DNN) with a fraction of the I/O transitions of machine A. Following the training phase, the DNN is validated with the remaining I/O pairs. Next, given an input, its predicted output is compared with the one that is observed from its circuit.\"},{\"title\":\"Conformance Testing for Finite State Machines Guided by Deep Neural Network\",\"subtitle\":\"Journal of Circuits, Systems and Computers\",\"date\":\"February 17, 2022\",\"description\":\"This paper proposes a Finite State Machine (FSM) testing technique based on deep neural network (DNN). This technique verifies the correctness of an implementation FSM-B of a specification FSM-A. Using the back-propagation algorithm, a deep neural network is trained with the input–output patterns for a given set of transition functions that specify an FSM. Initially, for FSM-A, the input patterns and the corresponding output patterns (I/O pairs) are generated. Then most of the patterns are used to train the DNN. Once the training is over, the DNN is validated with the remaining I/O pairs (around 20%). The model can be used for verifying the correctness of FSM-B after training and validation of the DNN. Some inputs are applied to FSM-B and the generated output patterns are compared with the predicted values of the proposed DNN. The difference of accuracy percentages between FSM-A and FSM-B is recorded and zero difference between them indicates the fault-free condition of the implementation FSM-B. To check the effectiveness of the scheme, the output- and state-type faults are injected to derive mutant FSMs. Experimental results performed on the MCNC FSM benchmarks prove the efficacy of the proposed method. Only a few numbers of tests are needed to detect the presence of anomaly, if any. Hence, the test time reduces significantly — resulting in an average test time reduction of 85.67% compared to the conventional techniques. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time a DNN-driven testing scheme is being proposed.\"},{\"title\":\"1)Transfer Fault Detection in Finite State Machines using Deep Neural Networks\",\"subtitle\":\"Artificial Intelligence Driven Circuits and Systems(ISED) [International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design ]\",\"date\":\"December 15, 2021\",\"description\":\"This work presents a testing scheme for Finite State Machines (FSM) based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). This technique determines whether a given implementation FSM-B is equivalent to its specification FSM-A. The input/output sequences (I/O pairs) for a given FSM train the proposed DNN. First, I/O pairs of FSM-A are generated using an adaptive distinguishing algorithm, and most of these sequences (around 80%) are used for training the DNN. After training, the remaining 20% I/O pairs are used for validating the derived DNN. After training and validation, the correctness of FSM-B is checked. A small number of vectors is applied to FSM-B and the generated outputs are compared with the DNN predicted outputs. Based on the similarity percentage between them, FSM-B is declared either as correct or faulty implementation of FSM-A. To check the effectiveness of the scheme, transfer-type faults are injected to construct mutant FSMs. The results of experimentation performed on the MCNC FSM benchmark prove the efficacy of this scheme. As only a subset of tests is needed to check the presence of fault if any, the testing time is remarkably less—resulting in an average reduction of 87.68% compared to the conventional technique. To the best of our knowledge, this DNN based testing scheme is being presented for the first time.\"},{\"title\":\"4)Clifford+T-based Implementation of Fault-tolerant Quantum Circuits over XOR-Majority Graph\",\"subtitle\":\"Microelectronics Journal\",\"date\":\"August 23, 2021\",\"description\":\"To build a scalable quantum computer that is sufficiently large to solve classically intractable problems is one of the biggest engineering quests of current times. But, the fragility of quantum states with short coherence time and vulnerability of quantum components towards external noise becomes an immense challenge to the physical implementation. Thus, the fault-tolerant architecture over the quantum error-correcting code (qecc) such as Surface code in optimal logical level are most desirable and can be achieved transversely using Clifford+-group. However, the -gate has high latency. In this paper, we introduce a template matching scheme over the Xor-Majority Graphs to realize a high scalable fault-tolerant quantum circuit. The proposed methodology is validated with multiple quantum benchmarks achieving an improvement of 71.98%, and 78.33% on average , and respectively over state-of-art, and at the same time completely avoiding any ancillary input. When ancillary inputs are permitted, an improvement of 92.77% on is obtained.\"},{\"title\":\"2)A Deep Neural Network Guided Testing Approach for Finite State Machines\",\"subtitle\":\"ISDCS 2021\",\"date\":\"March 3, 2021\",\"description\":\"Finite-State Machines (FSMs) lie at the heart of every digital system and verifying whether a given circuit implementation (B) of an FSM (A) conforms to its specification is an important task in the design cycle. In this work, a deep neural network (DNN) based technique for testing FSMs is developed. Given a set of transition functions that specify an FSM, a DNN is trained with the input-output sequences using the back-propagation algorithm. First, the input sequences and the corresponding output sequences (I/O-pairs) for A are constructed, and some of them are utilized to train the DNN. After training, the proposed DNN is validated with the rest of the I/O-pairs. Once the training and validation of the DNN is completed, it can be used for checking the correctness of its implementation (B) very quickly. Some inputs are applied to B and the observed output sequences are compared with those predicted by the proposed DNN. Based on the similarities between them, B is either declared as correct implementation of A, else it is declared as faulty implementation. The experiments are performed on the MCNC FSM benchmarks and certain faults are injected to form mutant FSMs. Experimental results reveal the efficacy of the proposed technique. Only a few tests are required to detect the presence of anomaly, if any. Hence, the test time is very less resulting in an average test time reduction of 85.66% compared to existing method. It is observed from the earlier works that this type of DNN based FSM testing method is presented first time.\"},{\"title\":\"7)Defect Tolerant Approaches for Function Mapping in Nano-Crossbar Circuits\",\"subtitle\":\"ICRCICN\",\"date\":\"November 22, 2018\",\"description\":\"Nanoscale designs are inherently with higher defect densities than traditional lithography based VLSI designs. So defect tolerant designs are required at this scale. Mapping different functions in a very large nanoscale crossbar containing defective cross-points is a hard searching problem. In this work, we use traditional sorting based methods followed by two other approaches based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) to find a proper assignment of different functions in the nanoscale crossbar circuit having defective cross-points. Our proposed methods based on GA and PSO work more efficiently with the increase of number of functions and crossbar area in comparison with the traditional sorting based methods. Experimental results show that our meta-heuristic based approaches outperform the sorting based approaches in terms of mapping success percentage.\"},{\"title\":\"5)Bioassay—Protocol to layout: A DMFB based implementation\",\"date\":\"March 29, 2018\",\"description\":\"In recent years application of digital microfluidic biochips has largely enhanced biomedical diagnostics procedures with provision for an alternative platform for traditional laboratory methods with miniaturized devices. Such device ensures better precision, higher scalability and integration as well as reconfigurability. In this paper we demonstrated a prespecified bioassay implementation using DMFBs with higher levels of complexity involving simultaneous sample preparation followed by targeted mixing operations. Here we developed efficient methods for architectural level synthesis to obtain optimal scheduling followed by resource binding that formulates effective front end design automation leading to layout in 2D array for bioassay implementation using DMFBs.\"},{\"title\":\"6)Defect Tolerant Approach For Function Mapping in Nano Crossbar Using Evolutionary Algorithms\",\"subtitle\":\"ICMCS\",\"date\":\"August 24, 2016\"},{\"title\":\"3)Bio-Inspired Methods for Defect-Tolerant Function-Mapping in Nano-Crossbar Arrays\"},{\"title\":\"Google Scholar Links\"}]",
