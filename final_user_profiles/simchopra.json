Formulated a 100 page machine learning research thesis over a year-long period. Applied multiple regression algorithms (logistic, LASSO, and elastic net), along with Decision Tree and Random Forest models, to a large-scale music data set (Million Song Dataset) and implemented K-fold cross validation for optimal model hyperparameters. Evaluated all 5 models using various classification metrics and identified the relative significance of metadata features compared to audio features in predicting hit song potential with 83% accuracy. Received an A for final senior thesis grade.\"},{\"title\":\"Excessive Positivity in the Sharing Economy: A Case Study with Airbnb Data in 5 US Cities\",\"start_date\":\"Feb 2021\",\"end_date\":\"May 2021\",\"description\":\"Advised by Professor Daisy Yan Huang. Designed semester-long project and completed independent research to produce 30 page report which applies machine learning/regression methods to pinpoint different underlying factors that contribute to a high number of positive reviews on Airbnb. Utilized Random Forest in R for feature selection from 50+ features, applied sentiment analysis using VADER in Python, and trained 4 LASSO regression models in R until an efficient champion model was found.\"},{\"title\":\"Optimism and Employment Success at Harambee\",\"start_date\":\"Jan 2021\",\"end_date\":\"Jan 2021\",\"description\":\"Completed social impact project in Python and worked in a team of 3 to develop metrics, identify patterns, and derive data-based evidence from survey results to inform an international youth employment accelerator's program management where to target resources for extended involvement.\"},{\"title\":\"B^2: Budgeting for Beginners\",\"start_date\":\"Jul 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2020\",\"description\":\"A minimum viable product of a mobile investing app, powered by machine learning, that utilizes market research and the users' financial aspirations to allow for efficient investment.\"},{\"title\":\"Choplery\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Jan 2020\",\"description\":\"An eco friendly alternative, centered around tackling plastic waste, for everyday utensils.
