Theproblem focuses on identifying people across different cameras oracross different frames of same camera. The main challenge lies inidentifying similarity of the same person against large appearanceand structure variations, while differentiating between individuals.Recently, deep learning networks with triplet loss has become acommon framework for person ReID. However, triplet loss focuseson obtaining correct orders on the training set. We demonstrate thatit performs inferior in a clustering task. In this paper, we design acluster loss, which can lead to the model output with a larger inter-class variation and a smaller intra-class variation compared to thetriplet loss. As a result, our model has a better generalisation abilityand can achieve a higher accuracy on the test set especially for aclustering task. We also introduce a batch hard training mechanismfor improving the results and faster convergence of training.\"}]",
