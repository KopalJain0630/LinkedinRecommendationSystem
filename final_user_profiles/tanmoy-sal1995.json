Now a question may ponder your brain as to why have been IT companieslike TCS have been chosen as a reference and here is why they have been included.The Tata Consultancy Services or simply the TCS has the largest market capitalization in theIndian Stock Market and this is one of the sole and most important reasons to include it in ourstudy as it caters to one of the largest investor and stakeholder’s base.The entire project report had been covered in several stages and parts and I had evaluated thevarious parameters where there was a scope of improvement and have tried our best to justify itto the best of my limited knowledge and efforts.\"}]",
