Reworked on algorithms using concept of neural network, random walk and other generic methods for finding outliers. - Simulated methods based on Local Cor-relational Integral and Replicating Neural Nework and both the algorithms worked well for HBK dataset. - Tools Used: Matlab/R\"},{\"title\":\"Parallel Algorithms for Hierarchical Clustering\",\"start_date\":\"Jan 2012\",\"end_date\":\"Apr 2012\",\"description\":\"- Designed and implemented sequential and parallel algorithms for Hierarchical clustering for datasets using MPI(message passing interface) system.- Result: Complexity for parallel algorithm decreased by increasing number of processors, while speed increased linearly. Tools; C/MATLAB\"},{\"title\":\"Web Based Data Mining: Selling Strategies for Online Auctions\",\"start_date\":\"Aug 2011\",\"end_date\":\"Nov 2011\",\"description\":\"- Aim was to come up with selling strategies for online auctions. Data for 300 sellers in ebay was collected- Used CART( Classification and Regression Trees) predictive modeling and proposed effective selling models as a function of seller's priority( success/price)- We found that factors like shipping price, seller rating and item description determined auction's success/failure - Also used logistic regression to check the effectiveness of CART.
