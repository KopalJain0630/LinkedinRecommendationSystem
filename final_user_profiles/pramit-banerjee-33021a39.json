Being a part of the relationship management team, I assisted in developing a 5-year fundraising strategy for the organisation considering its growth strategy. As the organisation was growing, being a part of the fundraising team, I had an opportunity to design a hiring process and onboard talented associates who could take charge of donor compliances and internal stakeholder management. My best project in this tenure was onboarding Development Impact Bond (DIB) for the organisation. It included collaborating with multiple third party organisations (group of funding agencies, management consulting firm, specialist organisation, media houses, etc.). DIB being a novel mechanism of social financing, I was given the responsibility to disseminate the knowledge on DIB to internal stakeholders (on-ground team, finance team, HR Team, Marketing team, Assessment team, Fundraising team) of the organisation.",
