In this study a quantitative model is being proposed to study the effects of circadian rhythms in algal growth processes to optimize the conditions required for maximum biomass growth. In existing literature based on algal growth and scaling up it has been found that abiotic factors such as light, nutrient, mixing rates among others are important means by which the growth of algal colonies can be studied and maximized. However, as in all living organisms a major controlling factor is the algae\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own ability of modulating the growth and stagnation period which can be studied by focusing on the importance of the circadian rhythms in algae. The microalgal species Chlorella sorokiniana is being studied with respect to its growth in different culture conditions, namely phototrophic and mixotrophic culture medium. These algal cultures are grown in a bubble column photobioreactor sparged with air. Accumulation of microalgal biomass is measured at fixed intervals of time to quantify the temporal growth rate of the algae, along with the varying parameters of light intensity, period of illumination, and carbon dioxide concentration. It has been earlier reported that the presence of heterotrophic nutrient medium aids the increase in the effective lipid content in the systems which accounts for better productivity and energy yield. It is found that the growth during the light dependent phase can be studied as a biomass concentration dependent negative sigmoid function, whereas the dark phases suggest a constant decrease in the biomass concentration which has been termed as night biomass loss."
