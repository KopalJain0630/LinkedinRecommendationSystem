This modeling utilizes data from various sources, including real-time surveillance and advanced algorithms, to understand how different factors—such as environmental conditions, human behaviors, and road designs—affect interactions between road users.\"},{\"title\":\"Maternal and Child Health Monitoring in LMICs\",\"start_date\":\"May 2023\",\"end_date\":\"Aug 2023\",\"description\":\"This research project aims to demonstrate that machine learning in satellite imagery and other publicly available geotagged data can accurately estimate key indicators of MCH status. Our hypothesis is that the village- and neighborhood-level prevalence of child undernutrition indicators, anemia in children and women of reproductive age, child and maternal mortality, and childhood illness episodes (diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections) can be accurately estimated from satellite imagery and other geotagged data. We further hypothesize that we can estimate these indicators accurately for a specific point in time as well as track changes over time.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"AI and ML Potency in Marketing Landscape: A case study\",\"start_date\":\"May 2023\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2023\",\"description\":\"The goal of this project is to improve and analyze marketing outcomes and key performance indicators through the use of AI and ML mediation. To identify emerging market patterns, performing in-depth analyses of market trends. Analyzing the efficiency and ROI of the implemented AI and ML strategies.
