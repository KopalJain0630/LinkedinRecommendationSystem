Through our analysis of the Indian stock market, we show that by random selection of stocks, the odds of outperforming the index are very low. Instead, if investors incorporate the ‘quality’ factor in stock selection, the probability of outperforming the index improves substantially and is statistically significant - at around 5% outperformance per annum at 90% confidence.By incorporating the quality factor, they can own a fairly small basket of 15 to 25 stocks, which captures 90% of the benefit of owning the benchmark at 90% confidence and generates strong outperformance compared to the index. This is much lower than the 45 stocks required for reducing only the diversifiable risk by 90% with a 90% confidence, as the previous studies suggest. These could serve as practical guidelines for portfolio construction and improving returns.""}]",,,,"Midnapore Sadar","https://www.linkedin.com/in/rudraksh-gupta-014192191","rudraksh-gupta-014192191","[{""interaction"":""Liked by Rudraksh Gupta"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/textifyai_ai-growth-learning-activity-7084373234032218112-ucC-"",""title"":""𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐏𝐫𝐨: Your Personal Growth Companion By- Aakriti Gupta \""GrowPro: Your Personal Growth Companion\"" is designed to facilitate your…"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQEvmuDi9tTOuA/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1689025539607?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nOdDyVfSM28ge0mHOo3Ddm-jj3LqIXTXa_rcMKj4YnU"",""id"":""7084373234032218112""},{""interaction"":""Liked by Rudraksh Gupta"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tanishq-bansal-2104_people-career-startup-activity-7072119946977193986-sV8L"",""title"":""Want to pursue a successful career in product roles?

This helps spread awareness regarding the various causes, cures and prevention methods of cancer. However, no proper analysis has been performed, which discusses the validity of such claims. In this work, we aim to tackle the misinformation spread in such platforms. We collect and present a dataset regarding tweets which talk specifically about cancer and propose an attention-based deep learning model for automated detection of misinformation along with its spread. We then do a comparative analysis of the linguistic variation in the text corresponding to misinformation and truth. This analysis helps us gather relevant insights on various social aspects related to misinformed tweets.""},{""title"":""Performance statistics and learning based detection of exploitative speculative attacks"",""subtitle"":""16th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers"",""date"":""May 2019"",""description"":""Most of the modern processors perform out-of-order speculative executions to maximise system performance. Spectre and Meltdown exploit these optimisations and execute certain instructions leading to leakage of confidential information of the victim. All the variants of this class of attacks necessarily exploit branch prediction or speculative execution. Using this insight, we develop a two-step strategy to effectively detect these attacks using performance counter statistics, correlation coefficient model, deep neural network and fast Fourier transform. Our approach is expected to provide reliable, fast and highly accurate results with no perceivable loss in system performance or system overhead.""},{""title"":""RATAFIA: Ransomware Analysis using Time And Frequency Informed Autoencoders"",""subtitle"":""IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)"",""date"":""Jan 2019"",""description"":""Ransomware can produce direct and controllable economic loss, which makes it one of the most prominent threats in cyber security. As per the latest statistics, more than half of malwares reported in Q1 of 2017 are ransomwares and there is a potent threat of a novice cybercriminals accessing ransomware-as-a-service. The concept of public-key based data kidnapping and subsequent extortion was introduced in 1996. Since then, variants of ransomware emerged with different cryptosystems and larger key sizes, the underlying techniques remained same. Though there are works in literature which proposes a generic framework to detect the crypto ransomwares, we present a two step unsupervised detection tool which when suspects a process activity to be malicious, issues an alarm for further analysis to be carried in the second step and detects it with minimal traces. The two step detection framework- RAPPER uses Artificial Neural Network and Fast Fourier Transformation to develop a highly accurate, fast and reliable solution to ransomware detection using minimal trace points. We also introduce a special detection module for successful identification of disk encryption processes from potential ransomware operations, both having similar characteristics but with a different objective. We provide a comprehensive solution to tackle almost all scenarios (standard benchmark, disk encryption and regular high computational processes) pertaining to the crypto ransomware in light of software security.""},{""title"":""RAPPER: Ransomware Prevention via Performance Counters"",""subtitle"":""Kangacrypt 2018"",""date"":""Dec 2018""}]",,,,,"https://www.linkedin.com/in/swastika-dutta","swastika-dutta","[{""interaction"":""Liked by Swastika Dutta"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anudeepnallamothu_future-of-cellular-t-mobile-nvidia-accelerate-activity-7242222787749167105-roG9"",""title"":""T-Mobile and NVIDIA are collaborating to transform telecommunications networks into AI computing infrastructure.

Through our analysis of the Indian stock market, we show that by random selection of stocks, the odds of outperforming the index are very low. Instead, if investors incorporate the ‘quality’ factor in stock selection, the probability of outperforming the index improves substantially and is statistically significant - at around 5% outperformance per annum at 90% confidence.By incorporating the quality factor, they can own a fairly small basket of 15 to 25 stocks, which captures 90% of the benefit of owning the benchmark at 90% confidence and generates strong outperformance compared to the index. This is much lower than the 45 stocks required for reducing only the diversifiable risk by 90% with a 90% confidence, as the previous studies suggest.

She was able to quickly come up to speed on a rapidly changing technology area, identify the relevant market sub-segments, work with stakeholders to source prospects, lead detailed technical discovery calls, and distill discovery learnings into an actionable strategy that she presented quite effectively at the VP level.
