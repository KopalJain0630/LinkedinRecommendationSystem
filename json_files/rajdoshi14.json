        "Abhinav Agarwal “Raj was one of the most active manager in the team of 22 who always went in the direction of work which will create the maximum impact, no matter how unconventional or non convincing it may sound in the beginning. He is the person who gets the job done, brilliantly, makes sure the team under him is working at the full potential and connects to the work personally.”",
        "Shilpa Kundapur “I had the opportunity to observe Raj while he worked as an intern in Philips Research. Raj is sincere and dedicated when it comes to his work. He was unfazed when he was asked to learn a completely new topic for his project. He delved into the task with great enthusiasm and quickly picked up the fundamentals. He was able to work independently in very little time and needed little guidance, in spite of being completely new to the topic. He demonstrated the ability to think out-of-the-box and generate new ideas. He also has great communication and networking skills. Raj will be an asset to any team he works with and I wish him all the very best for the future.”"
