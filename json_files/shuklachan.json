        "Amy Cell ‚ÄúI met Chandra when I was teaching a course on Project Management & Consulting at the University of Michigan. He was a pleasure to have in class and a great addition to the learning experience of his classmates. He made thoughtful observations during class discussions, and was always looking to learn and grow. During the consulting project, he used his tremendous creative skills to come up with innovative solutions to the problem One of the most amazing things about him is his continuous urge to adapt himself according to the circumstances to deliver the best results - which can be challenging during projects with a high level of ambiguity. It is commendable that with his rigorous class schedule & extracurricular activities he got the top grade in my course that testifies his potential, commitment to the task in hand, teamwork and presentation skills He will be an asset to the organization he joins.‚Äù",
