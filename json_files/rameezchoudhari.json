We have the best brainstorming casual talks because he is very accepting to criticism and constructive. His skill sets span across the domain verticals and he can fit right in whatever challenge comes his way. Overall he would be an asset to any working opportunity that comes his way”",
        "Bharti Solanki, PhD “Rameez traveled to the US from India to help us with Software Verification for Data Collection and Data Analysis. His extensive knowledge and experience from his previous works helped us understand the complexity of the new software. Rameez was quick to understand problems and issues and was able to convey the message to the India team. He was also able to figure out solutions and troubleshoot problems and resolve them very quickly. Response and turn around times were less than a day. It was a pleasure to work with him professionally and his easy-going personality carried over into a friendship. I heartily recommend him.”"
