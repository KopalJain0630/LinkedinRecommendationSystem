He first joined the organization within the role of mechanical engineer, but was always active in searching for opportunities to expand his skillset throughout his tenure at Sleepiz. Akshay demonstrated his analytical thinking by participating in activities of the data analysis group, he demonstrated his creativity through the mechanical design of the casing of the Sleepiz One+, and he demonstrated his people and project management skills by participating in grants and research projects with our academic partners. Most of all, Akshay demonstrated throughout his time at Sleepiz his excellent organization and communication skills. Akshay is a hard-working individual who puts the team's needs and priorities above his own. I'm confident he'll do well in any organization that has the privilege to work with him.” Show less"
