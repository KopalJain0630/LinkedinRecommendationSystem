        "Dr. Ashwani D. “He started as one of my summer interns to define an end-to-end unconventional workflow. He worked hard and played very well with rest of his team. We filed couple of patents. Afterwards, he was hired and joined the product management team and reported to me. He has the technical acumen and curiosity when it comes to finding technical or business solutions. What I like about him - simplicity and honesty. These days difficult to find honest professionals. He doesn’t pretend to be someone else. Second time, I brought him on data science team as an subject matter expert to help provide inputs and business insight for data science projects and defining the business cases. Over the years, he has grown significantly as a business professional. I am sure he will continuously progress in his chosen endeavors. Good luck!”",
        "Rajeev Pakalapati “Sri is an outstanding leader in the field of data science and its application to problems in the Energy space. What delighted me most about him was that he is continuously on the lookout for new technologies that he can bring to bear to solve technical problems. For example, he was the first in our group to explore the possibilities of Explainable AI to derive more actionable insight. But, beyond that what impressed me was he always found a way to resource this activity within his team while juggling a full project load. A continuous learner and a true asset to any enterprise.”"
