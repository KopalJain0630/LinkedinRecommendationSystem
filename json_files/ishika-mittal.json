        "‚ÄúIshika worked intensively with me for her summer internship for a research project I was leading . The project involved both mind-numbing detail work and demanding 'creative problem solving'. I found that Ishika had the temperament and skills for both worlds.I found her to be someone who could work independently with little guidance and someone who could be relied on to get the job done. I am confident that with her 'zeal and skill', Ishika will be a great resource for any organization she joins. I wish her the best for a great start to her career.‚Äù Show less",
        "‚ÄúI had the good fortune to mentor Ishika on various projects across different domains. She is very conducive to problem-solving with a knack for data-driven decision-making and was able to beautifully showcase that in the conceptualization of various high-impact projects. From technical adroitness to her forte in strategic analysis, Ishika is a complete power-pack for any team. The set of abstract traits that Ishika brings onto the table makes her a complete team player. A charming and charismatic individual, she is ever-ready to take on new responsibilities, learn cross-dimensional skills and drive all the team members towards the fulfillment of the outcome. Given all the fundoo qualities I mentioned, I am confident that folks in any organization would love to have Ishika on board in their mission. I wish her all the success in her life!‚Äù Show less"
