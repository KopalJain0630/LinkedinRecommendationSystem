        "Arantxa Sánchez “It is my pleasure to write a recommendation letter for Ms. Samata Chaudhuri, who will soon be a graduate student of the Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering (DIGS-BB) and the Dresden International PhD Program (DIPP)*. As coordinator of the DIGS-BB, I have had many opportunities to interact directly with Samata in recent years, and I personally believe that she has proven to be an outstanding student. Samata began her doctoral thesis work in the group of Prof. Dr. Stefan Diez at the Technische Universität Dresden (TUD; B CUBE) in September 2014. Her thesis work focuses on engineering nanotechnological applications of biomolecular motors and microtubules. In November 2015, she was awarded with a DIGS-BB fellow Award, which honours 1st year talented PhD students with a predoctoral position for the duration of the thesis and an annual consumable budget of 10,000.00 EUR. She has submitted her thesis work in October 2017, almost 1 year before the time stipulated in our regulations (4 years). She is a very talented young scientist, which focuses on her research, but also is eager to learn and develop her professional skills. Throughout her thesis time, Samata has attended several elective course offered by the DIPP to gain extra knowledge to support her PhD work. Within these courses we can find: Principles of Light Microscopy, Scientific writing courses and the 3-day PhD symposium in 2015. She has also received a training grant to support her participation in the Physiology summer course 2015 - “modern cell biology using microscopic biochemical and computational approaches” in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA. In addition, Samata has also participated in the organization of student activities within the PhD program. For example, last year she was part of the organizing committee of our annual Career Day. A 1-day event organized jointly by PhD students of the DIPP and postdoc of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG), which provides an opportunity to explore professional career paths inside and outside academia. Last but not least, Samata has recently successfully applied to the DIGS-BB Wrap-up program, which offers outstanding PhD students financial support for up to one year after submission of the thesis, to finalize a publication as 1st author in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. During her presentation she was able to defend in a comprehensive, clear and efficient manner her project, achievements and aims for her wrap-up period, despite the heterogeneous scientific background of the members of the award committee. Samata has begun her wrap-up period in November this year. The new publication resulting from the wrap-up period will be added to two other publications she already published during her thesis work. For all theses reasons, I’m convinced that Samata will make an excellent addition to any team and wish her all the best in her future endeavours.”",
        "Sumeet Pal Singh “Samata is highly perceptive, analytic and logical scientist. I have known her professionally for three years, and frequently find myself amazed by her analytic thinking combined with almost perfect memory. She is a hard-worker, but also works smartly. She is quick to assess the potential of a project and focus on important tasks to get the job done in the most efficient way possible. She is an expert in in-vitro biology, image capture and processing, and statistical analysis. Importantly, she is a good scientific raconteur, and can single-handedly develop, perform, report and edit a complete manuscript. She is an ardent reader, which shows in her superlative writing and editing skills. In all, she is a smart and accomplished scientist, who can perform well in multiple professional settings. ”"
