        "Marcial Gutiérrez “As part of the Ericsson Summer 2021 Internship Program, Annie came to work with us at the Product Development Unit Converged Core to do some Data Science work around using Machine Learning for predictive network resources consumption, as well as operationalizing these results for an internal web application. Annie’s main contribution was on doing the exploratory data analysis, modeling, and operationalization of a trained predictor of resources consumption for one of our products. Her execution throughout the course of the project was outstanding. On the Data Science part, she comprehensively gathered and discussed her insights on the datasets, models’ performance, and interpretability, always providing relevant comparisons and recommendations in every sprint. On the operationalization part, she was able to learn how to use Dataiku’s Data Science Studio (DSS) in a remarkable speed and prepare the ML training pipeline for her datasets in line with the provided requirements and expectations to integrate this with the web application. Along the way, she also made sure that everything was thoroughly documented. I can attribute Annie’s superb results to how structured she is in the way she approaches a problem. Additionally, she possesses great communication skills, using the appropriate technical language, which is also evidence of her level of competency in the area. On top of this, she was a great team player and a very pleasant person to work with. I would definitely recommend Annie for any type of Data Science role due to her ability to quickly understand the problem at hand and approach it in a structured manner, especially if delivering relevant easy to digest and timely results are of utmost importance.”"
