She was the one who helped us get settled and we could see an aura of confidence in everything she did and everything went seamlessly. From how she managed everything, I could see a future leader in making. In just how she conducted herself, I believe she would be a great team member and an asset to whoever she works with. Good luck”",
        "Asitava Chanda, CFA, FRM “I interacted with Nitika when I landed at my alma mater for the 25th reunion of our batch. This event was attended by more than 100 members from our batch who came from various locations in India and abroad. Nitika played a significant role in liaising with various internal and external stakeholders. She was also involved with handling the invitation and registration process, transportation & logistics and accommodation at the guest house. She was there in the guest house early in the morning to ensure that I had a vehicle at hand to take me to my destination. The event was thoroughly enjoyable with punctuality maintained. It created a great memory for me. Delivering such an event requires an immense organising skill. Nitika and her colleagues deserve a resounding applause.”"
