Maneet is one of those rare individuals who will not just stop at being a boss but progresses beyond, to guide you, helps you learn and becomes a mentor in the truest sense of the word. His vision and confidence towards connecting rural artisans to global bulk buyers is commendable. I have not only enjoyed working with him but learnt a lot from him especially in the way of trusting a team and giving them the creative space and decision making required to make for great team work.‚Äù"
