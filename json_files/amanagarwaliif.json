The frequency and extent of financial debacles have led the masses to call for reforms in the form of a new \\\"international financial architecture and a self sufficiency model\\\" with improved financial literacy. This paper believes that markedly better financial literacy has the capacity to improve macroeconomic growth. The Goal Programming Model for making multi-objective, capital structure decisions using accounting proxies has been tested on an Indian Agricultural Firm. The model may prove highly beneficial to firms hoping to achieve optimum or satisfying practical solutions to capital structure decisions that incorporate multiple goals in a systematic and scientific way.In the re-emergence of a multi-polar economic world, building a stable and growth-oriented future for all nations will require freedom from barriers and the free flow of market mechanisms as part of this large society.
