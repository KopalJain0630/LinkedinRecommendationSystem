With freshness and intelligence, he can contribute a lot to any project with complete diligence. I must say I have learned a lot from him during his internship period and I wish him all the best for all his future endeavors.”",
        "Naina Kapoor “Amaan is constantly eager to take on new challenges and demonstrates devotion by completing duties on time and exhibiting all the expected traits. His dedication and efficiency are admirable. He has demonstrated his analytical abilities to diagnose problems and find feasible solutions in a variety of situations. Simple words would do injustice to his abilities, and to sum it all up, he is and would be an asset to any organisation.”"
