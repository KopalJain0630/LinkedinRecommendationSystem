        "Vidhant Jain “It is rare that you come across a person like Mr. Devendra Agrawal. I have the opportunity to work under the wing of a person who is more a mentor than a boss. Working with Devendra has been pure pleasure – I have learnt all that I know about life and profession from him and he has been kind and patient with me during times when I could not live up to his expectations. Being one of the greatest motivators I have met, he is the “go to person” when conflicts arise. He looks out for his team but is not one to draw attention to himself deliberately – his work does that for him. He has built a reputation as someone who has a broad vision and this vision is what will take a company places. His simplicity is sure to leave everyone is awe. Any person would be happy have Devendra as his superior, he does't only mentor a person but is ready to go a step further to hand hold you and teach you if he finds you worthy of it. Thank you DA!”"
