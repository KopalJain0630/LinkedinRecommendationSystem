        "Santosh Maheshwari ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the privilege of working with Kumar on few engagements together and known him for little more than 5 years now. I find Kumar to be a well-grounded and down to earth person. He is a calculated risk taker, pragmatic leader and realist who seems to grasp ideas holistically whilst still taking note to the more acute details. I found this to be incredibly valuable in working with him, as it allows him (and for those who work with him) the ability to explore and understand nearly all possible perspectives to an idea and its numerous applications. He is an hard worker and value creator in the truest sense.‚Äù",
