        "Saurabh Mehta ‚ÄúI worked closely with Akash for building an enterprise product within Games24x7. Pre-Product/Market Fit stage is always full of ambiguities; trying to build something people want. Akash understood this very well. He has this ability to seamlessly juggle between (i) talking to potential customers (ii) synthesize information (iii) partner with engineers and execute predictably. His entrepreneurial spirit and technical background helped him immensely to gain credibility within a very short time and he always motivated engineers and designers to give their best. His biggest strength is his \"can do\" attitude and he never shies away from rolling up him sleeves and jumping into adjacent areas such as mock design, prototype and coding too üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I thoroughly enjoyed working with Akash and I hope our paths cross again!!‚Äù",
        "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúRelentless focus on customer experience, is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Akash. I‚Äôve had the pleasure of knowing Akash for around 2 years, during which Akash was pivotal in leading product development with multiple stakeholders for a global scale product. Above all, I was impressed with Akash‚Äôs ability to focus his attention on minute details and break down complexities into well structured functional blueprints that made a dramatic difference to the productivity of entire team. And, of course, no matter the number of high intensity discussions we had, Akash always made sure to make everyone smile. All those unplanned happy hours, talk about being a sport!! Akash is a great product leader and would be an asset to any team.‚Äù"
