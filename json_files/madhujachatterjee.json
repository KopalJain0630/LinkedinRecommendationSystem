        "Geet Chaturvedi “I have been knowing Madhuja since 2013 and it gives me immense pleasure and pride to say that she is a visionary leader. Reason I say so is on the basis of seeing her 10 years professional journey and the way she has demonstrated her skills & capabilities that not only benefitted to her as an individual but people around. She is someone who likes to take up challenging task, move out of her comfort zone and does things with full honesty & hard work in areas she carries interest in. She comes with a blend of process & technology driven experience and is extremely focused to make her career in the field of Data Science. Not only her professional traits speak volumes, her communication and behavioural aspects do count equally! She is humble, polite & understanding and can surely help anyone to get rid off from their critical situations. Summarizing to what I experienced, I would highly recommend her to all companies, the Big4s etc. as you won't just get an employee to fulfill your org goals, you will surely get a leader who will lead from the front. :) Thank you. Regards, Geet Chaturvedi”",
        "Jeewanjot Singh “Since our Post Graduation, Madhuja has excelled in every domain. She was the finest personality i met in our college. Always proactive, confident and having complete knowledge of each and every aspect of her domain. She got various appreciations for multiple corporates and was favourite of every faculty. Her achievements were not limited to Post Graduation as she astonishingly managed to complete another MBA in digital marketing and various other state college events. She is undoubtedly powerhouse of energy and immense knowledge. Her superiority continued when she joined Tata housing and proved herself outstanding in one of the most challenging domain i.e. real estate. When she entered into retail banking as SM she has impressed everyone with her performance and interpersonal skills. Her BDRs found her as one the most active and approaching manager due to her kind nature. All this positivity and effective people handling is evident when she tops the periodically sales tables. I wish her good luck and hope she will continue shining like this throughout her career.”"
