Consider there is an institution that has the main power station and there are 25 substations. Now, the main station will be the Server and the 25 substations will act as the Clients. The voltage will be read in the Clients using Arduino and the RMS values will be calculated and the values will be sent to the PC in the Client via the Serial Port. Now, these RMS values will be stored in the localhost of the Client and as the Server will make a request, the Clients will send the values to Server(using Java). Hence, we will have the voltage pattern of all the places of an institution. Using this data, we can analyze and find which areas are consuming more power. This project has great scalability and the data obtained from it is of great use.\"}]",
