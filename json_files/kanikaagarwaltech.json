An intelligent, inspired and passionate woman, she is going to have an amazing career if she always remember to follow her passion and work with great people who embrace her spirit and understand that keeping her light alive is what is critical to future success. I know I'll enjoy watching Kanika kick goals every step of the way in the coming decades. When I think of Kanika, I know a star has been born, and I was thrilled to be there at the beginning of her career journey. Definitely one to watch!‚Äù",
