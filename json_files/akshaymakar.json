We had ice ages and warmer periods. Climate reacts to whatever forces it to change at the time , humans are now the dominant forcing. Three main elements due to this are artic amplification, climate change and global warming. The earth had been warming rapidly since 19th century and Artic is warming faster. In the recent years the average temperature hasn’t gone up but the amount of heating has increased. By the end of century Artic temperature can rise up to 7-8 degree. Apart from the land, climate change footprints can be seen in deep ocean . With global ocean getting warmer and more acidic, the habitat and food webs are changing with them. Oceans had absorbed one-third of the carbon di oxide which dissolve in water to form Carbonic acid with the pH ranging between alkaline 7.8-8.4 the extra acid has pushed the pH down by 0.1 on average. Also oceans had taken up heat 90% that is trapped by greenhouse gases raising sea level temperature by 0.1 degree every decade. Sea water at 700m had heated up to 0.015 degree Celsius every decade. So, “humans are responsible for all the warming we have experienced since 1950’s.\"}]",
