        "Lynette Marie BIDDER ‚ÄúI have worked with Ninad since April 2022 on a project developing a new finance model for QA Limited. I was extremely impressed by his extensive knowledge and skills with financial data analytics. He has an ability to extract large amounts of data and applying logic to create a workable, more efficient process. He has a clear understanding of the work involved and ensure it is done to the highest possible standard. His communication through out the project to myself and the rest of the project team was clear and easy to understand. On a personal note he is a great person to work with and I have learnt alot from him.‚Äù",
        "Meenakshi Hemadribhotla ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of working with Ninad at WorldRemit. He is a proficient manager and an excellent strategist with commercial sense in everything he does. He was always there for the team and me in understanding the company‚Äôs processes to a great extent while working on the most critical projects in the treasury function. His willingness to go out of his way to help team members always made him stand out. His unique skills made the whole experience a dream, and I must say he leads by example. He was encouraging and supportive when I had to take a new programming language course over the due course of the project and was highly approachable throughout. He is a very kind and genuine person who responds to every query with sheer thoughtfulness on a personal front. I felt welcome and motivated in his presence. Thank you, Ninad, for making this transition smooth and comfortable!‚Äù"
