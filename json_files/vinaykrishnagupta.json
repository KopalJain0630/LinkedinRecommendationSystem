We are still working together on different business projects. Based on my interactions, I can confidently say that Vinay has a unique talent for bringing people and ideas together. He's good at helping others become successful in their businesses by giving them support through his startup, Antino, and his other initiatives of mentoring. I've seen him grow as the founder of Antino, and it's been a fantastic journey. What's remarkable about Vinay is his ability to stay calm and focused when facing tough challenges. He has a rare gift of motivating and inspiring those around him, making everyone give their best. I hope he does well and accomplishes even more in his future dreams and goals.” Show less"
