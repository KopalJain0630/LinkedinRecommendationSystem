        "Yama Temouri “I am writing in reference to Kian’s plans to find a position in an international company. I have known Kian for 8 months now as a lecturer and course director on the MSc International Business programme at Aston Business School, UK. Kian has been one of the best performing students during his MSc studies and ranks in the top 10% of his class of 114 students. Kian is a very intelligent, conscientious and hard working person who is enthusiastic about his work and pleasant to work with. During my module in 2015, he did very well in both my exam and in other modules and contributed to discussions in lectures and tutorials. During the group oral exam, Kian has shown that he can work effectively in a group to present with classmates succinctly the workings of one of the largest automobile companies – BMW and answer challenging questions that assessed his critical thinking abilities. This has shown his academic ability to grasp well theoretical and empirical issues on a range of management topics. He has good verbal and written communications skills; is an independent learner and researcher. I therefore highly recommend him to you, and I am confident that he will do very well on his chosen career path. ”"
