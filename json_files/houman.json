        "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúI am honored to recommend Houman Haghighi. Foremost, Houman is a visionary who anticipates industry and product trends and seeks opportunities to produce revenue in those areas.

One of Houman's greatest virtues is his thoughtfulness and caring for everyone he meets, which is a lot of people because he is also a master networker. Houman is a valuable business partner and would be a vital component to any companies success.‚Äù",
        "Ricardo dos Santos ‚ÄúHouman has to be one of the most multi-skilled professionals I've ever met. He's equally great at building client relationships, managing technical projects and creating new business ideas of his own. Houman has a superior command of Web 2.0 technologies and how mobile devices and their unique capabilities provide additional value for the various generations of users. What I especially admire about Houman is his incredibly gracious, contagious and positive personality - he doesn't know the meaning of a bad day or a customer/colleague's problem he can't solve.‚Äù"
