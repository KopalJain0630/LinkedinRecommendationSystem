Pranjal delivered multiple projects end-to-end working independently as well as with a team. He has a very high learning agility which makes him a perfect fit in any fast-paced project. Pranjal works very well with ambiguous requirements. His tendency to take upon a task without a fear of failures has always set him apart. Due to these traits, he has always been able to start projects from scratch and deliver them on-time in-full. Pranjal is very transparent about his opinions and voices them in any setup. This helps him question his own progress and also suggest betterment opportunities in his peers' work. He is constantly looking for critique to improve his work as well as his skillset.”"
