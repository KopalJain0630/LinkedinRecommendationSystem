Being a motivated self-starter has helped me to pay better attention to detail and believe in accuracy and perfection. I am a people’s man and can take advantage of my communication skills to bond within a team. Time management is something I have taken control of late, which has helped me to categorize assignments on priority. To top all this, my blissful demeanour has always allowed me to be a good stress buster for my team members. With an appropriate background I believe I can perform better than expected.",
