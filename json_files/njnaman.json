I can say with certainty that Naman is an intelligent, hardworking and highly motivated self-starter. As one of the only BA in Saxo of his age and experience he has crafted a very unique path and broken a lot of the beliefs around high experience required for the position. He has worked very hard to amass a great deal of knowledge and subsequently led and brought in a lot of projects that he has seen through end to end, from getting in requirements from our clients to delivering the final solution. Personally, it has always been a pleasure working with him since he is a highly supportive individual who is crystal clear with the requirements that he brings in and helps resolve any roadblocks in task scoping and analysisâ",
