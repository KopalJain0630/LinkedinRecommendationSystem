His hard work was evident when he pulled all night long stints to deliver important deadlines for a client and securing critical revenue for the company. But besides his hard work, dedication, enthusiasm and intelligence, his most important virtues lie in his innocence and the simplicity of his nature which make him a highly valued addition to any team. His cool and calm composure helps him and the team in breaking complex problems into simpler solutions and achieve deliverables more efficiently.”",
        "Ankit Singh “I had an opportunity to work with Rahul as his direct manager in Schlumberger. I found Rahul as a self-motivated, driven, efficient and hard-working engineer. During his assignments he consistently demonstrated highest standard of commitment and focus to deliver successful results. He showed exemplary attitude towards continuous learning and developed sound skill sets as a well engineer in a very short duration of time. At a very young stage in his career Rahul took on the responsibility of working as Assistant Well Site leader and successfully supervised the rig operations & well managed the drilling crew. He has the capability to work and interact within a multi-disciplinary team & multi-cultural environment and is an excellent team player. I wish him all the best for his future endeavors and feel confident to state that he can be a valuable asset to any team he works with. ”"
