        "Apoorvi M. “Aadhar is my peer at Columbia University in the MS Applied Analytics program - and we took two classes together - statistical programming in R and data visualization in Tableau. I had a great experience studying with Aadhar for each of the courses, and even had the opportunity to work with him on a group project. What stood out the most about Aadhar was his ability to learn quickly and his enthusiastic approach towards his work. Further, he had a brilliant work ethic - he would always complete his portion of the work on time, and was never late to a single meeting, regardless of the hour of the day. In terms of his technical skill set, he is knowledgeable in Python, R, and Tableau too. Given that he did not previously have an understanding of these tools, it is impressive how rapidly he has upskilled himself, and sufficiently well to leverage these tools on various projects. Further, he was always willing to help others understand concepts taught in class, which is indicative of a leader who uplifts others and helps them succeed. Lastly, he was able to take a very detail-oriented approach towards his tasks which elevated the quality of whatever he worked on. I can say with confidence that Aadhar will be an asset to any organization that he works for since not only gives equal dedication to whatever he does but is also refreshingly open to feedback. Good luck with all your future endeavors, Aadhar!”",
