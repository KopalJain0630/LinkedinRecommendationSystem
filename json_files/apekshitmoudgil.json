He is a self driven person who brings phenomenal energy to the team. I fully recommend him for his product management and business analysis skills. He is a great communicator too which just adds on to all the good things he brings to any organisational set up.”",
        "Naggappan Ramasamy “Apekshith was one of my student / learner in the Product Management Program at Growth School. From day one, I was amused by his dedication, hard work and consistency in learning and writing on Product Management. He is super talented, great thinker and has high agency. It is difficult to see someone with a mix of skill and agency. He writes a lot about Product Management and has inspired other students in the cohort to write as well. He is always there to help his fellow Product Aspirants. I should say that I was gifted to mentor a student like him and people like him inspire you to teach more :) All the best man! You will reach great heights!”"
