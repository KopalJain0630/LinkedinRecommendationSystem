        "Saurabh Malge “My association with Vinamra started briefly while learning the crux of Product Management at Nextleap Fellowship program. Vinamra is just like his name - humble and always has a knack for learning something new, while making sure of teaching his learnings with fellow teams and peers. Vinamra is dedicated, passionate and has a creative way of getting tasks at hand done! I learnt a lot just in the duration of 2 1/2 months from Vinamra. His skills in Product Sense, Presentations, No code tools and other aspects of Product Management are outstanding. Vinamra will be an asset to any organization he'll be a part of. Good luck to him for the future. 🙂🙋🏻‍♂️”"
