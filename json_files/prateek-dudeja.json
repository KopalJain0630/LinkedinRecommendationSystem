        "Tejas Mehta “I had the privilege of working with Prateek for a couple of years building product for the OneDrive and SharePoint team at Microsoft. Among many other things, he and I were co-founders of what is now known as Viva Connections. Working on a V1 product at Microsoft that spans multiple teams, geographies and disciplines is no easy task, and I observed Prateek demonstrate a high degree of team and product leadership, as well as a high self awareness and EQ. He excelled at persevering on a number of ambiguous, complex, cross-company product challenges, and always generated clarity of outcomes for stakeholders - whether negotiating for partner teams to take on dependent work or fiercely advocating for prioritization of resources to focus on the most important customer needs. He has a strong product sense, and his intuition rarely failed him. Peers look to him for guidance, and teams learn tremendously from his insights. Prateek is a rock star product manager and leader, and any team would be lucky to have him.”"
