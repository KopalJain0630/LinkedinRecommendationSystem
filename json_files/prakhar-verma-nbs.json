        "Medha Prabhakar “I had worked with Prakhar on a customer project using SAP Analytics Cloud in 2022. He showed a lot of intent and sincerity in assessing the customer need and coming up with the required solutions. Because of his thorough investigations and a good overlap with the rest of the team, we were able to timely uncover the roadblocks and provide workouts and explanations. Prakhar had joined SAP as an early Talent but his maturity at work helped me in managing the project with relative ease. I wish him all the success and fulfillment in his future endeavors.”"

It can be used to obtain a feasible prediction model but prior to model construction, the features that might influence the impact should be studied and the factors that can project the impact such as the diameter of the hole, the velocity of the particle prior to the collision, etc. The basic knowledge about the debris properties and its correlation with the materials is a must for any prediction technique to work. Following which the steps can be taken to obtain data of the collision\"},{\"title\":\"Studying the effect of various factors on Housing Prices in King County using Hypothesis Testing and Linear Regression\",\"start_date\":\"Dec 2018\",\"end_date\":\"Feb 2019\",\"description\":\"Here, dataset is taken from harvard and various factor and their effect on housing pricesof King County was studies by me.
