He has deep curiosity to learn and improve. He is polite and can work very well as a part of the team. His research capabilities are also praiseworthy. I highly recommend Mayank!”",
        "Ashish Mohan “Mayank Arora showed exemplary organising skills in planning and executing the alumni reunion held at the beginning of 2020. This event was attended by more than 150 attendees from various alumni batches, joining from India and from various other locations globally. He was in the event coordination committe and was instrumental in making all events run smooth - without any hiccups of resources, availability of key people or anything. Delivered the event agenda over a packed three day schedule flawlessly. Was responsible for organizing Entertainia and the Musical Nights on day 1 and day 2 of the event. The entire event ran like clockwork and the entire visiting alumni group provided feedback that this was one of the best events that most of us had experienced recently. Kudos to Mayank and the overall Student Alumni Committee for their contribution in delivering an excellent event experience, my best wishes in all his endeavours.”"
