From day one she went above and beyond expectations, actively supporting promotion and coordination of large-scale events such as career fairs, as well as contributing as a marketing assistant in photoshoots. Bhavya is incredibly proactive, hands-on, and always brings fresh, creative ideas to the table. Her passion for marketing is evident in the exceptional quality of her work and the enthusiasm with which she tackles challenges. Bhavya’s zeal, skills and her naturally warm, friendly and outgoing nature make her a valuable asset to any team, and I highly recommend her to any employer seeking a talented and driven marketing professional.”"
