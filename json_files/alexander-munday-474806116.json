        "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúWe just closed a transaction selling our business of significant size through Chapter International. After talking to almost 50 Advisors, Brokers and Investors directly, we decided to go with Chapter International. Alex Munday was our primary contact here. His superb service, business acumen and outstanding skillset caught our attention and was the initial reason we decided to go with CI. He guided us through the whole process, helped to prepare all required documents and gave us great insights into the industry. His experience and talent are exceptional. He has a great network of investors that made it easy to find a perfect match within 10 business days. Alex led throughout the bidding process, helped to create the shortlist of compelling offers and pick the right investor. Since Alex was in the driver seat all the way up until signing, we could comfortable rely on his expertise and recommendation. The negotiation was very intense, conducted in 3 languages and with many lawyers involved - we had some difficult phases - but in times like these there is nothing more important than a calm, constructive and trusted advisor leading the process and finally finding a way to achieve a deal that works for all parties involved. We are grateful to have worked with Alex - otherwise the deal would not have happened. I can only recommend working with Alex, his exceptional talent will boost every deal.‚Äù",
        "David Penner ‚ÄúThis year we decided to sell our e-commerce company (mainly focused on Amazon). Initially we didn‚Äôt want to go through a broker and contacted Alex by accident. After the first call with Alex our impression of the value he could add was so significant, that we wanted to continue the path with him. Alex helped us to polish the company presentation and sent it out to his network. Within 10 business days we had good offers on the table. We signed the NDA and DD & negotiations started. During this very intense and stressful time Alex presence and support was so important for us. We did this kind of transaction for the first time. Alex supported us with his knowledge from other deals he made. This way we were able to keep a strong position but also be realistic. During the negotiations we had several times the impression we are stuck in the process. Alex always was a great help to find the point and move on. He was also a great sparring partner to discuss things openly. Looking back I‚Äôm so glad to work with Alex. Without him we would not have such a good deal and handover!‚Äù"
