            "description": "I had a very amazing experience interning at American Express. I was part of the Artificial Intelligence Learning and Governance, a branch of the Global Decision Sciences Team at Amex. During my internship, I worked on two projects. I started out with “Amex Insights – Leveraging layout information for marketing creative evaluation” where in Graph Neural Networks were used to embed the creative for analysis. We were able to evaluate the creatives as a whole up to nearly 96% accuracy. Furthermore, the model was built in such a way which allows for certain node level explanations and comparisons. After nearly 3 weeks into the internship, I took up another project “Financial Statement Spreading – Extract and Store Metadata with Financial Statements” which entailed extraction of data about tabular data in financial statements. I wrote a Custom Date Parser that was able to correctly infer a valid partial or complete date from a text up to 92% accuracy. I also worked on extracting sub headings from the document albeit the accuracy could only reach 50% due to the difficulty in correctly identifying a sub heading from all other text.Thanks to the amazing team at Amex, I was able to manage my time in both projects and deliver substantial results in both. They had a very inclusive and welcoming work culture, which enabled me to bring my best and authentic self to work.",
