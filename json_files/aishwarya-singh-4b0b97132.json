One of the very first things that impressed me about Aishwarya was her ability to grasp complex database design concepts and implement them with ease. Aishwarya showed impressive levels of independent thinking and problem solving. Another area of Aishwarya’s skillset that I observed are her excellent communication skills, helpful manner and highly positive approach to achieving tasks. Aishwarya is a great team player and fitted into a fast-paced, dynamic team environment with ease. It was a pleasure to have her on the team and was able to be part of all the activities we have going on in the centre thereby showing a flexible and adaptable attitude. I would unreservedly recommend Aishwarya as she is an exceptional talent.” Show less"
