        "Brittany Lane Blitzer “Akanksha is, quite simply, an absolute joy to work with. I had the privilege of bringing her onto my team while at Unreasonable, and it was one of the best decisions we made. She communicates proactively and openly, she builds relationships easily, and she is consistently curious about ways in which she can grow both personally and professionally. I could count on Akanksha to offer creative ideas, implement projects on time, keep me informed, challenge my thinking when I needed it, and ask for help when she needed it. I fondly think back on our weekly 1:1 meetings – we worked hard and had a lot of laughs. She is both humble and ambitious, a deep and critical thinker, and an asset to any team.”"
