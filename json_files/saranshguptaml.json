Using an integrative approach, we analyzed a publicly available merged NSCLC transcriptome dataset using machine learning, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and bayesian modeling to pinpoint key cellular factors and pathways likely to be involved with the onset and progression of NSCLC. First, we generated multiple prediction models using various machine learning classifiers to classify NSCLC and healthy cohorts. Our models achieved prediction accuracies ranging from 0.83 to 1.0, with XGBoost emerging as the best performer. Next, using functional enrichment analysis (and gene co-expression network analysis with WGCNA) of the machine learning feature-selected genes, we determined that genes involved in Rho GTPase signaling that modulate actin stability and cytoskeleton were likely to be crucial in NSCLC. We further assembled a PPI network for the feature-selected genes that was partitioned using Markov clustering to detect protein complexes functionally relevant to NSCLC. Finally, we modeled the perturbations in RhoGDI signaling using a bayesian network; our simulations suggest that aberrations in ARHGEF19 and/or RAC2 gene activities contributed to impaired MAPK signaling and disrupted actin and cytoskeleton organization and were arguably key contributors to the onset of tumorigenesis in NSCLC. We hypothesize that targeted measures to restore aberrant ARHGEF19 and/or RAC2 functions could conceivably rescue the cancerous phenotype in NSCLC. Our findings offer promising avenues for early predictive biomarker discovery, targeted therapeutic intervention and improved clinical outcomes in NSCLC.\"},{\"title\":\"Development of a virtual reality based fire training simulator and machine learning based path guidance system: A case of hospital fire breakouts (IHIET-AI, 2020)\",\"subtitle\":\"International Conference on Human Interaction & Emerging Technologies: Future Applications 2020\"}]",
