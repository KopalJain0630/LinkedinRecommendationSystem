        "Tapas Shivpuri ‚ÄúChandan is by far the best leader I have worked with. He is a powerhouse, and has an infectious energy that always charges the team up. It's usually said that a leader is as good as her/his team, but a person like Chandan just turns it around for you. Very subtly he will get the best out of you, without you realising the contribution you've made for the team and the organisation. Such is his impact. I'll always look forward to a day where our paths cross in future!‚Äù",
        "Mohit Sardana ‚ÄúChandan is a supremely motivated, enthusiastic and passionate individual. He believes in rolling up his sleeves and getting into the trenches to get his work done if need be. It was a pleasure creating the Advisor Network with Chandan from scratch as he saw each roadblock as a problem to be solved and carried his team over these roadblocks with sheer force of personality. Chandan is also not shy of leveraging his immense personal network for the organization and he would be an asset to any organization. ‚Äù"
