        "‚ÄúI have had the pleasure of working with Bharat for over 3 years at Worxogo. Bharat was primarily responsible for building out our product to drive innovation in organisations. Given that we were a startup, he was involved in multiple additional responsibilities - including client relationship management, opportunity identification, implementation support. He brought an endless energy and curiosity to his workplace everyday pushing his team members and colleagues to identify product improvements and implement them in a time bound manner. This meant that he was working with multiple stakeholders quite regularly in a very collaborative, challenging, creative and high energy environment. He is able to clearly put forth his ideas in a manner to secure buy-in from multiple stakeholders. He was anchoring the product roadmap end-to-end and these discussions and communication was a very essential part of his role at worxogo. I expect that skill will make it very easy for him to bring a lot of clarity in his role in any organization. He was instrumental in recruiting technology professionals for his team. He onboarded the team and executed his deliverables in a timely and efficient manner. Overall, Bharat was a consistently high performer in his Product Management role, collaborated well across teams and provided depth and clarity in his communications. I wish him all the very best!‚Äù Show less",
        "‚ÄúI worked with Bharat for over 3 years at Worxogo. During that period, like with any startup, Bharat handled many different roles with aplomb and confidence. I was impressed with Bharat's ability to work collaboratively with both peers and his juniors. In his role in Product Management of a fledgling product, he had to bring together different stakeholders - both internal (sales, engineering, customer success) and external (customers and vendors). He delivered this excellently, even in tough situations. Bharat is a creative thinker, as he displayed in his PM role. He is able to also articulate his ideas to different groups within the company and gain consensus and buy in. This is a valuable trait that will make him successful in any future role. Bharat also interacted closely with the Founder group at Worxogo, actively participated in the discussions and contributed his ideas fearlessly. I wish him all the best!‚Äù Show less"
