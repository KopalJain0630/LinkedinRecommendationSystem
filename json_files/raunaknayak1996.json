Firstly , if we are considering the vehicle sectors that normally run on fuels, be petrol, diesel, and gases. The main emission are SOX and NOX. The emissions in form of gases disintegrate as separate molecules of the non metals and recombine with atmospheric moisture to become respective acids, and come down as acid rain.Secondly , if we switch for devices that are mostly electrical and electronic based , the prime attention switches to the electricity generation possible. And in that cases most of our power plants adopting the modified Rankine cycle are 38 percent efficient( involves 2 % of human error).Thirdly , the generated power cannot be stored . The signal’s voltage level is stepped up at a generating transformer and thereby through transmission lines (minimizing losses through Joule’s heat by reduced current).And in an average the vehicles which are electricity enabled consumes 48 V.Now if we can system a device that would lessen the electricity consumption, it would help in the lesser encroachment in the non renewable source, electricity which is further generated at the cost of another non renewable source, fossils.Lastly , this could be a long term impact to the economical as well as the environmental factors governing the nature.\"}]",

It maintains a database in the security control center where-from information can be accessed. In this prototype, all the apartments and service centers of the city are synchronized and the users get a platform from where they can access them. The ‘Smart-City’ consists of the following features:- •Apartments equipped with various sensors •Control of Home Appliances over Phone, using DTMF; PASSWORD protected •RFID based entry to apartment •Emergency Services and Apartments Synchronized •Database of activities recorded for security purpose •Updates on User’s Phone or Laptop •Daily Activities Automated •Live Surveillance of Home without Loss of data •Auto Info for servicing of Appliances sent to service provider •Capacitive touch sensor Wearable Device.The entire city is connected over by IoT modules. Apartments and other service centers communicate using ESP-8266. The functioning of the ‘Smart-City’ has been categorized into THREE parts interlinked with each other. •Automation of Apartment •Synchronization of city services •Surveillance and Security of the Apartments and City.
