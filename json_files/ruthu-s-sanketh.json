She has that amazing knack for getting things done at speed while maintaining top-notch quality. Even during the most intense moments, she kept on a high level of performance. Her strong problem-solving skills and proactive communication played a key role in executing some of our critical company-level projects. We learned a lot together by reflecting upon our work and sharing the best practices, and this exercise highlighted her other strong sides - being an avid learner and a great collaborator. On a personal level, Ruthu's drivenness and empathy make working with her easy, fun, and uplifting. I have no doubt that she will continue to excel and be a rockstar contributor to any team she works with or leads in the future! 🚀”",
        "Pedro Justo Pereira “In H2 2023, I had the chance to work with Ruthu during her Product Strategy Graduate Programme at Revolut, where she proved to be an asset to the team from day one. Not afraid to dive in, she excelled across multiple projects in a short period, navigating through challenging problems with strong output accountability, consistent hard work, and the courage to speak her mind. It was a pleasure working with Ruthu, and I'm confident that her drive and intellectual vitality will propel her on a great journey of growth and lead to a fulfilling career.”"
