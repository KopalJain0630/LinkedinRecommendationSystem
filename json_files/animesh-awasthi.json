Scoring a PSG is time-consuming and tedious, with substantial inter-rater variability. A deep-learning-based sleep analysis software module can perform autoscoring of PSG. The primary objective of the study is to validate the accuracy and reliability of the autoscoring software. The secondary objective is to measure workflow improvements in terms of time and cost via a time motion study.Methodology: The performance of an automatic PSG scoring software was benchmarked against the performance of two independent sleep technologists on PSG data collected from patients with suspected sleep disorders. The technologists at the hospital clinic and a third-party scoring company scored the PSG records independently. The scores were then compared between the technologists and the automatic scoring system. An observational study was also performed where the time taken for sleep technologists at the hospital clinic to manually score PSGs was tracked.Results: Pearson's correlation between the manually scored apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) and the automatically scored AHI was 0.962, demonstrating a near-perfect agreement. The autoscoring system demonstrated similar results in sleep staging. The agreement between automatic staging and manual scoring was higher in terms of accuracy and Cohen's kappa than the agreement between experts. The autoscoring system took an average of 42.7 s to score each record compared with 4,243 s for manual scoring. Following a manual review of the auto scores, an average time savings of 38.6 min per PSG was observed, amounting to 0.25 full-time equivalent (FTE) savings per year.Conclusion: The findings indicate a potential for a reduction in the burden of manual scoring of PSGs by sleep technologists and may be of operational significance for sleep laboratories in the healthcare setting.\"},{\"title\":\"An automated heart rate-based algorithm for sleep stage classification: Validation using conventional polysomnography and an innovative wearable electrocardiogram device\",\"subtitle\":\"Frontiers in Neuroscience\",\"date\":\"October 6, 2022\",\"description\":\"The rapid advancement in wearable solutions to monitor and score sleep staging has enabled monitoring outside of the conventional clinical settings. However, most of the devices and algorithms lack extensive and independent validation, a fundamental step to ensure robustness, stability, and replicability of the results beyond the training and testing phases. These systems are thought not to be feasible and reliable alternatives to the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG).\"},{\"title\":\"Chapter 20 - Computational approaches for vaccine designing\",\"subtitle\":\"Elsevier\",\"date\":\"October 1, 2021\",\"description\":\"Traditional approaches to design a vaccine have failed in providing broad spectrum and long-term protection against various bacterial and viral infections. In the postgenomic era, identification of a specific antigenic region for activating a specific arm of an immune system has been the greatest challenge. To address this critical issue, in the last two decades vaccine designing has become a significant field of interest for researchers. Numerous web-based resources have been developed, which have proved extremely helpful in in silico vaccine designing. In this chapter, we discussed computational tools designed for the antigen selection and related immunological databases, in silico tools developed for linear and conformational B-cell epitope prediction, resources developed for T-cell epitopes or MHC class I and II binders, and tools developed for other miscellaneous properties of vaccines, such as toxicity, half-life, and delivery. In the end, we also discussed the role of next-generation sequencing technologies in vaccine development.\"}]",
