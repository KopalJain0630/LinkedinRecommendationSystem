While at tGELF, Atish showed great commitment to all the tasks that were given to him, he is an independent worker and also a good team player, a combination that it is difficult to find. He worked on different projects showing commitment, a great sense of responsibility and and efficiency. Embrace ambiguity is one of the strongest assets that Atish holds, even though some projects did not have all the clarity that was needed, he was always asking questions and being comfortable with the unknown. Working with Atish was an amazing and rewarding opportunity, he is a brilliant young man with a bright future ahead, full of innovative ideas and sharp critical thinking. ”",
