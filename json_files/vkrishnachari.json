        "David Cardno ‚ÄúI worked with Venkatesh for over 3 years. He is very resourceful and committed and achieved good results in both business affairs (as CFO of USA subsidiary) and in managing a project (like delivering the group audit by a deadline). Venkatesh thinks outside the box and can be creative in his approach to ensure desired results are achieved. I enjoyed working with Venkatesh and have no hesitation in recommending him.‚Äù",
        "Prateek Jain ‚ÄúVenkatesh recruited me in Lornamead and I have really enjoyed working for and with him. Venkatesh is one of the best bosses I have worked for. His creativity and out of the box thinking has always impressed and motivated me. In Lornamead he has quickly moved up the ranks from an accountant to the position of CFO for our biggest business, within a span of five years. This reflects the confidence that Lornamead‚Äôs management had in his intellectual and leadership capabilities. He was very instrumental in the turnaround of our US business from a loss making to profit making. He has always provided me necessary guidance & coaching as a boss and a colleague at Lornamead which has been really helpful for my own career progression at Lornamead. On personal front as well he has helped me a lot in settling down in UK and provided me all necessary guidance and support. Venkatesh is a great asset for any organisation and I would highly recommend him for any organisation looking for a dynamic CEO.‚Äù"
