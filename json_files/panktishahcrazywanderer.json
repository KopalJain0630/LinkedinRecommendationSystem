I write a travel blog where I share my experiences, tell the stories I collect from my expeditions and share them with the world.

I have traveled across India, solo, and have also traveled 9 countries, with a longing to one day travel the entire world.

My idea of fun is to have new experiences, try new and good food, experience decent infrastructure and experience temperate climate. I engage with my travel experiences professionally as well by doing blogging campaigns, Business and Luxury Travel - Collaboration and Consulting, I am a travel Instagrammer, as well as a freelance travel writer and social media strategist.
