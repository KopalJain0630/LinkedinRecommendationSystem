He is highly skilled, dedicated, and passionate about his work. Nafis's ability to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to complex problems was truly impressive. He was a great team player, always willing to lend a helping hand to his colleagues. His positive attitude, professionalism, and excellent communication skills made him a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend Nafis to any organization seeking a talented and dedicated individual.”",
        "Mohammed Raihan Uddin “I have taken multiple lab courses of Mr. Islam and it is my pleasure to write about him as he is one of the students who stood out among his peers through his active presence and interactions in the class. I trust Mr. Islam to convey any messages to his peers as he was one of the most stalwart students of the class. During his C programming lab, he showed his critical thinking ability by constantly being one of the first students to solve any difficult problem posed in the class. During the Engineering Mechanics Lab, after finishing the assigned task I have seen him help his fellow classmates with their lab work. These denote his distinctive quality of being a fast learner and a good leader at the same time. Mr. Islam, being a critical thinker, avid learner, and more importantly, a compassionate human is bound to bring positive changes to any institution he is part of. I wish him all the success for his journey. - Mohammed Raihan Uddin Lecturer Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering Islamic University of Technology Gazipur 1704. email: mohammed.raihan@iut-dhaka.edu”"

A flow of air is passing inside a square enclosure with a heat source and a pollutant source on the right and bottom wall, creating double-diffusion, as well as two ventilation ducts on the upper sides asserting mixed convection. The Galerkin weighted residual method is implemented, which is based on the finite element method. For fixed values of Lewis number, Le = 0.5, Richardson number, Ri = 1, Reynolds number, Re = 100, and Prandtl number, Pr = 1.01, simulations were done with Buoyancy Ratio, Br = −10, 1, 10 and 20 over dimensionless time, τ = 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. The results have been shown with the streamline, isothermal lines, iso-concentration lines, average Nusselt and Sherwood number, average fluid temperature, average mass concentration, and the average temperature at the square cavity's exit port plots. The findings have been discussed to ensure understanding of the changes in parameters, and an enhancement in heat as well as mass transfer was seen with the rapid change in dimensionless time. This specific study could be a guide for designing air conditioning and ventilation systems.\"}]",
