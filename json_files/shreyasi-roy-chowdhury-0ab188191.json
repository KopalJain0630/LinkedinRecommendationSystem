This  facilitated inclusion of static rank, a popularity signal to the ranker, taken up by other team members. - Designed a stable metric based on discounted cumulative gain (DCG) score to analyse Bing Shopping results based on offer relevance to query, quality of offers, and savings aspects. -Automated the relevance quality measurement pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges by prompt engineering the judgement guidelines for model input. This approach proved to be 60% cost effective while increasing the throughput by almost 10x-Analysed market-wise relevance-based DCG scores for Bing vs. Google Shopping for a fixed queryset. Tagged queries for categories using LLM, enabling slicing and dicing of data for further analysis. Created a monitoring dashboard for score comparison.- Analysed DST (dynalic shop tab) triggering and suppression, in order to find the reason behind a sudden volume drop for Shop tab in a specific time-period. Analysed Coverage, FSDAU and FCDAU, precision and recall of DST triggering, and suprresion by other verticals to reach to a possible conclusion. Created monitoring dashboard for future use, facilitating easy debugging for any future volume drop scenario.",
