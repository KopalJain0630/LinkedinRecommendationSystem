Wishing you and Prozo great heights!‚Äù",
        "Anurag P. ‚ÄúAshvini and I worked together on a EBIDTA improvement program for a large hospital as part of one of our assignments at McKinsey. During the study, Ashvini demonstrated a unique ability to forge deeper, trust driven relationship with senior clients (Medical Superintendent and Project Director) in a short amount of time. He was able to mobilise people at all levels for the project and this led to we having very quick turn around time for most of our data/client meeting requests. All this combined with his problem solving skill set and execution capabilities ensure that we had a home run on the project. Another unique aspect of Ashvini's personality was his eagerness to learn new skills. He did a remarkable job of getting insights out of the vast amount of data available with the client to help prioritise areas of high EBITDA impact. Ashvini also took ownership of mentoring a recently joined summer associate during this fast paced project. Overall, it was great to work with Ashvini. ‚Äù"
