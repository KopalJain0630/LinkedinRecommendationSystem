Operated at 1.9 K above absolute zero, the material properties of superconductors and superfluid nitrogen vary by several orders of magnitude over a range of only 77 K. The heat transfer from metal to nitrogen goes through different transfer and boiling regimes as a function of temperature, heat flux, and transferred energy. Electrical, magnetic, thermal, and fluid dynamic effects are intimately coupled, yet live on vastly different time and spatial scales.The results obtained from comparisons show that the adiabatic models were able to simulate quenches with the desired accuracy. The adiabatic analysis in the commercial simulation tools is more efficient and stable for various scales of spatial discretization. Similarly, the helium-cooled models can simulate quenches with satisfactory accuracy. Nevertheless, the models are not compatible with the automatic time-stepping method of the simulation environment. The use of the fixed time-stepping method in the models resulted from the coupled analysis in COMSOL being far more time-consuming than in QP3.\"},{\"title\":\"MECHANICAL SEAL\",\"start_date\":\"May 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2019\",\"description\":\"Mechanical seal is a device that prevents / restricts undesirable flow of fluid in rotatingequipment from the high chamber pressure to the atmosphere.\"},{\"title\":\"LAKE CLEANER BOT \",\"start_date\":\"Aug 2017\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2018\",\"description\":\"Nowadays, a lot of manual labor is being employed in the cleaning of the rivers, lake and other local water bodies. A large amount of time and money is wasted by the government in this task to reduce the river contamination. Hence to provide a Technical Solution for a Time and Cost Effective method to reduce the manual labor, we thought of making an automatic bot which can efficiently do all the chores in less time. This is the basic motive behind our âLake Cleaning Botâ The main aim of the project is to clean the polluting water bodies with the help of a cleaning bot which is controlled wirelessly and further can be made autonomous. The bot has to perform the functions of collecting the solid trash present in the water bodies like plastic bags, plastic bottles, small objects, etc. Further it should also be able to cut the small plants and weeds growing on the water surface and also collect them in the trash pit. After this process, it should empty this trash into a disposable pit.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"Mechaical Obstacle Mechanism\",\"start_date\":\"May 2017\",\"end_date\":\"Aug 2017\",\"description\":\"The main moto of the project is to make a hammer like mechanism for GRP using the normal instruments at the same time to learn the basic manufacturing techniques.
