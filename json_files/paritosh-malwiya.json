His expertise in investment advising and his investor-centric attitude make him an asset to any project. I highly recommend Paritosh for any investment-related opportunities.”",
        "Rushikesh H. “Paritosh and I worked together for a period of 2 years wherein I reported directly to him. Working with Paritosh was always a pleasure not only because he is an energetic and positive individual but also because there was always an opportunity to learn something new from him every time he was in the field. Along with a great mentor, Paritosh is an excellent orator with impeccable qualities of salesmanship and team management. Whoever has ever worked with Paritosh will concur with me when I say that his most unique quality is to maintain his composure under stressful situations.”"
