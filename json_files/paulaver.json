He is a true multitasking person actively involved in deal sourcing, fund raising, partnerships, structuring and deal execution. He also loves deep technology and innovation and his experience spans multiple countries. On top of that, he has great people and communication skills. I definitely recommend Paul for any roles that are well-matched with his experience.”"
