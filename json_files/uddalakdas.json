Unlike traditional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. This review delved into the fundamental principles underlying circRNA biology, highlighting their unique structural advantages and translational potential. We examined recent advancements in circRNA vaccine design, focusing on their application in oncology. As the circRNA-based cancer vaccine is a relatively novel technology, findings from all the major studies describing its efficacy were discussed. We further investigated their combination with other immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, that ensure the maximal anticancer effects of circRNA vaccines. Large-scale manufacturing, immunogenicity optimization, delivery systems, and other challenges and future directions in this field were also discussed. This study aims to thoroughly analyze the state-of-the-art and potential future applications of circRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy, highlighting them as exciting possibilities for next-generation cancer therapies.\"},{\"title\":\"Discovery of natural compounds as novel FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) therapeutic inhibitors for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia: an in-silico approach\",\"subtitle\":\"Aspects of Molecular Medicine, Elsevier\",\"date\":\"November 30, 2024\",\"description\":\"FLT3 mutations, observed in approximately 30-35% of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cases, drive leukemic proliferation and survival pathways, presenting a significant challenge in clinical management. To address this therapeutic need, we employed a comprehensive computational approach integrating pharmacophore screening, molecular docking, ADMET analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify potent inhibitors targeting FLT3. Utilizing ligand-based pharmacophore models generated from experimentally proven FLT3 inhibitors from BindingDB, we screened over 400,000 natural compounds from the COCONUT database. Hits identified through pharmacophore screening underwent further evaluation via Lipinski and Golden triangle criteria to ensure drug-like properties. Molecular docking against the FLT3 receptor, combined with ADMET analyses, facilitated the prioritization of lead compounds. Subsequently, three promising candidates were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to assess binding stability. Our findings reveal three top-performing compounds, demonstrating robust and stable binding affinity and favorable ADMET characteristics. These compounds hold promise as potential scaffolds or leads for developing novel FLT3 inhibitors in AML therapy.\"}]",
