On top of his diligence, Shivank is also a process expert and a disciplined team manager. I am truly impressed by Shivank's dedication to his own personal growth. In my view, what sets Shivank apart from other is that Shivank genuinely seeks feedback with substantial value. This is a rare quality which requires patience and listening skills because valuable feedback is sometimes not the music to the ear. Once Shivank receives feedback, he would think through and implement with full alignment. I highly recommend Shivank to any organization who needs a process expert and a diligent manager.”"
