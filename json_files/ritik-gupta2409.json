Ritik had been very collaborative, an enthusiastic team member who worked with his partner intern to present deliverables in a timely, organized fashion. Ritik showed humility in accepting suggestions for changes, improvements and worked to provide a high-quality presentation and a working proof-of-concept on Go-lang. Ritik had been proactive and self-driven to solve problems and achieve results. Additionally, Ritik had worked on Android and ML projects and had picked up in no time. I have no hesitation in recommending Ritik for any software development engineer role. +1 for a positive and never giving up attitude.”",
