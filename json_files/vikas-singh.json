This technology is changing the face of P2P lending in finance across the globe. Some Banks in Russia, VISA has started investing highly in the Blockchain R&D.Though its application are not just limited to just the financial domain. It can be applied to store the transaction details for anything of value. In my case, 'transfer of property'.We used the Ethereum's MIX IDE to develop the use case. We simulated the environment in which we can allocate the property( a string name for ease of understanding) and then transfer it to the registered user. This user then can transfer it to some other valid owner.We take care of the double spending in our 'smart contract'. We also make sure that any property which is not present in the Blockchain should not be allowed to be transferred to any person.This is one such cut throat technology, on which huge banking applications are being built or planning to build.\"},{},{\"title\":\"Alternate of 3-D PIN: Pattern as a TXN password in financial system\",\"start_date\":\"Jan 2016\",\"description\":\"In today's financial system, most of the TXNs are authenticated via OTP. It is used for passing the 'something you have' barrier of 2FA. Though, OTP is still unreliable and error-prone to business & huge dependency on Network(congestion).What we tried here in this project is to create something equally complex of an OTP( restricted only for digits, not alphanumeric), yet easy to remember transaction password, based upon the patterns and wished to replace the it.As lots of Application are now omitting the OTP and applying algorithm to generate a token in the backend while the transaction taking place to authorize the 'something you have' in 2FA.We want to provide this tool to the security agencies which provide 3-D PIN. They provide it, but seldom used by consumers and have larger acceptance. One main reason for not using the 3-D PIN is also that they are random 6 numeric digits and are hard to remember. So thats two loopholes in 3-D PIN.That's why peopl generate the OTP and seldom care for 5-10 seconds that they wait. but if that's converted into the amount of time an avg people wait, just to receive an OTP, in an year, it can easily come to 2-4 Hours. depending upon the no of TXNs he makes.So, What we tried is to provide the complexity of OTP and ease of remembrance within one single alternative & thats 'patterns'. People use and create patterns for remembering things for longer period. This project was converted into a successful demonstration to the jury as well.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"Generating a trigger on winking of the eye using front Camera in Android devices\",\"start_date\":\"Jan 2013\",\"description\":\"The Idea was to flip pages of pdf, turning to next/previous song, volume up/down by the wink of eye & many more fun-things.We successfully demo-ed this idea.
