He is extremely independent, reliable and dependable. As a contributor, Oscar has strong data analytical capability, combined with strong nose for value and problem solving skill. He thinks outside the box and employs first-principle thinking. As a team leader, he is the type of person that lifts up the team spirit, even in the most strenuous condition.
