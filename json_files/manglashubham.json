Metal oxide nanoparticles have emerged as effective antimicrobial agents. In this work, co-precipitation method was used to synthesize CuO-NiO-ZnO mixed metal oxide (MMO) nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray powder Diffraction (XRD) analysis which confirmed the formation of all three phases, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) analysis, Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), UV–Visible Absorption Spectroscopy and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed the particle size distribution of nanoparticle. Bacterial growth curve, reduction in bacterial CFU (colony forming unit) and cell integrity study confirmed the antibacterial activity of MMO nanoparticle and showed detrimental effect against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains. Nanoparticle attachment to the bacterial cell wall and ultimate annihilation of the cell was observed in the FESEM study of interaction of bacterial cell.\"},{\"title\":\"Social Media Advertisement Outreach: Learning the Role of Aesthetics\",\"subtitle\":\"ACM SIGIR 2017\",\"date\":\"Aug 2017\",\"description\":\"Corporations spend millions of dollars on developing creative image-based promotional content to advertise to their user-base on platforms like Twitter. Our paper is an initial study, where we propose a novel method to evaluate and improve outreach of promotional images from corporations on Twitter, based purely on their describable aesthetic attributes. Existing works in aesthetic based image analysis exclusively focus on the attributes of digital photographs and are not applicable to advertisements due to the influences of inherent content and context based biases on outreach. Our paper identifies broad categories of biases affecting such images, describes a method for normalisation to eliminate effects of those biases and score images based on their outreach, and examines the effects of certain handcrafted describable aesthetic features on image outreach. Optimising on the describable aesthetic features resulting from this research is a simple method for corporations to complement their existing marketing strategy to gain significant improvement in user engagement on social media for promotional images.\"}]",
