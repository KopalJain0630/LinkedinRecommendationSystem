Although we were working on different projects within the group, it was clear from the beginning that Aadesh was smart, motivated, and had a particular expertise with software engineering and distributed computing. He used these skills to benefit an important research project within the group. I got to know Aadesh even better when we took an advanced data visualization class together. In addition to the usual collaboration on coursework, we were partners for the final project in the class. We worked together to process data from the 2021 'IEEE SciVis Contest' and created some innovative and useful visualizations. Aadesh was quick to master and extend the skills we learned from the class, and he was a very reliable person to work with. Any company would be lucky to have him.”"
