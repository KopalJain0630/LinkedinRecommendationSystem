Trust: Puts a lot of faith in his team and that kind of is itself a morale boost when your CEO shows that level of confidence in yourself. Leadership: Takes a decision follows it, evaluates it after some time, takes feedback from the team and modifies his tactics and redo. The fact GrowthMart has undergone so many changes in strategies and flow charts after going through multiple discussion with everyone in the team is itself a sign of a leader who is ready to listen and not just put his views on others. Understanding: He understanding and boosted my mood to the best of his ability. He understood that I needed space and lets me off meetings if required then, and hence kinda grateful.”"
