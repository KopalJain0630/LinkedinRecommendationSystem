On the social level, he is a people person, a team player with excellent communication skills in local and international business matters. I wish him all the best.”",

I had the pleasure of working with him for 5 years at VIVA Telecom as a peer and subsequently as my immediate Supervisor. Mohamad's ability to juggle multiple projects was unprecedented. He is an organised professional, pragmatic leader and realist who seems to grasp ideas holistically whilst still taking note to the more acute details. His strong analytical, presentation and communication skills distinguished him from other colleagues at VIVA. Mohamad would be an asset to any organisation.”"
