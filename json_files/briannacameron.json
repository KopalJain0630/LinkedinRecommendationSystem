Morley, PhD ‚ÄúBrianna worked in the Department of Family Medicine at SUNY Upstate Medical University, under my supervision, while she was completing her Master of Public Health degree. I also taught Brianna in graduate research methods coursework, and served as her advisor for her MPH capstone project. I have had many opportunities to see Ms. Cameron shine. She has outstanding analytical skills, and truly takes the initiative when it is needed. She is also a very strong scientific writer, and a very intelligent contributor to any team with which I have seen her be involved.‚Äù"
