        "“Prachie was our Summer Intern in my team called the \"Globalization Programs Strategy Office\" - in her tenure she clearly understood our requirements to build a Business Intelligence Dashboard for all things Globalization @ NetApp. Not only did she nail it, but she did it ahead of schedule. Prachie is an incredible bright young woman who I hope to be able to hire one day! Some of the skills she portrayed where around listening well, positive personality, asking when in doubt, learning presentation skills, working late if needed, knowing her way around fast, integrating to the team very nicely, and obvioulsy coding to spec. She found solutions on how to pull data from different systems and she did that with minimal supervision. She offered different designs, and she thought for us. She surprised us as we had not always had such experiences with interns. She defenitely has a bright career ahead of her.” Show less"
