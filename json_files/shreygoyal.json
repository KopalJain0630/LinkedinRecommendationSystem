        "Mayank Lodha ‚ÄúShrey worked with me for a really challenging strategy development project with a South East Asian Conglomerate, involving understanding their different businesses & recommending a 5 year growth strategy. His strong analytical skills, ability to understand new businesses quickly and dive deep into the details stood us in good stead during the project. He is an asset to any team leader, as he is extremely focused on the end objectives, never shies away from taking extra responsibility, or burning the midnight oil if required. It was indeed, great fun to work with him as well as he kept the environment light and pleasant with his interesting stories, both fiction as well as non fiction. Wishing him all the best for his new stint !!‚Äù",
        "Jatin Gulati ‚ÄúShrey has been an outstanding consultant for us at Auctus, appreciated in equal measure by the teams that he has worked as part of as well as by the clients that he has worked with. There are 4 related traits that Shrey has, which have brought him success at Auctus and will most certainly bring him loads of success at his next endeavors - very strong analytical ability; strong focus to channel this analytical ability properly; healthy aggression to actively & continuously keep moving towards what he wants to achieve; and remarkable maturity to work with whoever he needs to achieve what he has set his mind to. I wish him grand success in the times to come. ‚Äù"
