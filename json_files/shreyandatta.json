This could be realized by analysing the traffic data relayed by device nodes present all over the city in a real-time environment. The node is a cloud-linked camera-integrated MPU equipped with GSM communication. The captured video frames are processed which is then analysed collectively to suggest the most appropriate route to the vehicles.\"},{\"title\":\"Conceptualizing Implementation of Piezoelectric Materials in Transportation to Harvest Energy.\",\"subtitle\":\"International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology e-ISSN: 2395-0056,p-ISSN: 2395-0072\",\"date\":\"March 22, 2019\"},{\"title\":\"Conceptualising Implementation Of Piezoelectric Materials In Transportation To Harvest Energy\",\"subtitle\":\"ISTE NIT Durgapur\",\"description\":\"Published as Conference Proceedings of AISSEC 2018, by ISTE NIT Durgapur chapter.\"}]",
