        "Peter Cellier “I was Sarjana's people manager while she was a research analyst at EAB, during a period of considerable organizational change for the division and professional change for Sarjana. At that time, Sarjana worked with the division's Growth Strategy team on a range of projects that required data analysis, visual design, verbal and written communication/presentation, collaboration, critical thinking, insight generation, and problem solving skills, along with a considerable amount of adaptability and professional maturity as her work to support the team's strategic mandates shifted, sometimes unpredictably. Sarjana was always eager and prepared to jump into a new project or a new challenge, and consistently produced high quality work even under tight deadlines and with little direction. She was also a fantastic team member, contributing not only a strong work ethic and generosity to her colleagues, but compassion, empathy, and humor as well. Sarjana was a natural relationship builder, and demonstrated a knack for both identifying and improving ways to connect and collaborate with colleagues within and across divisions. Sarjana's primary projects during our time working together included auditing a business school client's website and producing high impact recommendations for improving its efficacy, helping design a workshop to share those recommendations with the client, helping pioneer new client intelligence systems and analyses to inform research conducted across the division, and producing numerous analytical reports for internal and external stakeholders. Sarjana was an incredible coworker, and I enjoyed every minute of our time working together. Any company or organization would be lucky to have her!”"
