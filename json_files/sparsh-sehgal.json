        "Daniel Robson “Sparsh has been a committed student representative throughout her time at King's Business School. She shows genuine care for her peers and routinely offers support. This is evident in the pastoral roles which she has fulfilled and trained for throughout her degree, e.g. Women's Officer for KCLSU, a trained Peer Supporter complimented by mental health first aid training, and her role in the It Stops Here team, which aims to eradicate incidences of harassment on campus. She is a vocal advocate for equality and justice and is not afraid to speak out against inequality. Sparsh is extremely driven and seeks out as much opportunity as she can to further her knowledge and develop her skill-set. She took part in the Common Purpose Global Leaders Experience in Johannesburg in 2017, an international leadership experience which immerses students from various backgrounds in a new and often challenging culture and asks them to work in diverse teams to come up with solutions to issues facing the city. During the programme students learn about cultural intelligence and how this can help bridge divides between different groups of people in order to arrive at solutions which are suitable and respectful of people's needs. Sparsh has completed the King's Professional Leadership and Skills course which develops various soft skills which are desirable for the contemporary workplace. The effect of this is that she has successfully completed an internship in the finance sector and will be continuing in this field when she graduates. Sparsh is a member of the King's Business School Social Planning Committee which organises the School's annual end of term celebration. With her colleagues she organised an event for over 700 staff and students. In doing so she demonstrates good teamwork and leadership skills, an ability to negotiate, and also creative flair. She is proactive and delivers on objectives. She is an active member of the student community and is able to speak to her peers with confidence and without pretense. Students are open and honest and this enables Sparsh to provide frank but constructive feedback to academic and professional colleagues. Sparsh has supported out induction events for the last two years, presenting the student portion of our sessions to over 2000 students. She is a confident and engaging public speaker. Sparsh is professional and tenacious, friendly and caring, She makes the most of the opportunities university has to offer and has maximised her potential in the process. I have no doubt she will fulfill it!”"
