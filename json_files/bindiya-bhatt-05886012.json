I've been most impressed by her ability to take complete ownership and drive projects to a logical conclusion. Her focus in building and scaling up brand relationships was a key driver behind the success for the category. Bindiya is also a great team player and is able to manage multiple objectives in complex situations. She is an asset to any team she is a part of.‚Äù",
        "Nishima Kaler ‚ÄúBindiya was my colleague in the last organization. I have seen her leading the categories with very high ownership, keen business understanding and sharp eye for detail. Bindiya has been able to turnaround businesses profitably while scaling the topline. She is also a great people manager and is adept at leading large teams. I am sure she will be a great asset to any organization she chooses to work with. I wish her the very best in her future endeavours!‚Äù"
