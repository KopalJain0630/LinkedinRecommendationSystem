        "Niharika Anjan “I had the privilege of working with Akash Nath for three years, during which he served as Expansion Manager at U&I. In this role, he was responsible for launching our programs in new cities, skillfully building connections with on-ground candidates and inspiring them to embrace our vision. Akash’s strength in community building is remarkable. He articulates our mission effectively, rallies volunteers around shared goals, and consistently delivers projects on time. His authentic connections with co-workers create a supportive environment that drives major initiatives forward. One of his most significant achievements was overseeing the implementation of our afterschool English program across multiple cities in Kerala. Akash successfully united various regions into a cohesive and high-functioning unit, showcasing his leadership and strategic thinking. Akash thrives on challenges, approaching them with a “bring it on” attitude and a willingness to take on additional responsibilities. His impact on U&I and the communities we serve has been profound, and I have no doubt he will continue to excel in any future endeavors.”"
