She played an instrumental role in developing the annual operating plan for Suta and spearheaded the effort to execute it too. Nikita has sharp business acumen and is naturally oriented to solving complex business challenges via accurate problem assessment, immaculate SOPs, and assertive negotiations. To top it all, she is an extremely hardworking professional. Given her innate leadership ability, Nikita would be a great fit to the CXO/VP suite of any organisation -- large or small. I recommend her for opportunities in the strategy formulation/execution space.”",
        "LinkedIn User “I had a truly enriching experience working with Nikita during her time at Suta. The learning curve was steep, and I’m deeply grateful for her mentorship. As a confidante and source of empathy, she is an inspiring figure to look up to. While reporting to her as Chief Business Officer, I had the privilege of collaborating on various projects that offered invaluable insights beyond my focus on marketplaces. Nikita guided me in developing effective negotiation strategies, navigating legal complexities, and approaching projects with a fresh perspective. Nikita is a powerhouse. Her ability to multitask while delivering meticulously executed projects is genuinely inspiring. I hope we have the opportunity to work together again in the future. Wishing you all the best, Nikita!”"
