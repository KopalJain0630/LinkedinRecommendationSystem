        "‚ÄúI am not sure if there exists a textbook check-list of characteristics for an ideal co-founder but looking back, if I had the option of starting UNICOLR all over again, I am sure I cannot find a better co-founder than Ganesh. He is a ‚Äúgo-getter‚Äù who always has a smart solution to a complicated problem. When we started, Ganesh was hired as a Tech consultant for a different web product. But soon we realized our forte is online fashion and we had a clear path of what was required to be done. Back then, Ganesh was running his own web-development company and it takes a leap of faith and courage to get out of one‚Äôs comfort zone and get into uncharted territory. And that‚Äôs what he did when he joined UNICOLR as a co-founder. At UNICOLR, he took care of all things tech ‚Äì from building our internal ERP to getting our web store live in a week ‚Äì he did everything single-handed. He is an excellent project manager who can complete complex tasks within narrow deadlines without getting carried away with all the noise that surrounds a startup. On a personal level, I have seen him evolve from being a Tech developer to an efficient manager who can envision a project, from beginning to end and knows how to priorities and get things done in time. I am extremely proud of having a co-founder like Ganesh and with his technical skills and curiosity to try out and learn new things in life, I am confident he will achieve great success in future. All my best wishes for your next career step.‚Äù Show less"
