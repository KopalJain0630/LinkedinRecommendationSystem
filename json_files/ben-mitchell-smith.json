        "Ahmed Al-Abdin “Ben is an incredibly talented individual. It has been a real pleasure working with him for the past few years as his programme director for BA Marketing. Ben has so much energy, drive, determination in everything he does and an incredible work ethic to match. He possesses excellent teamwork, communication, critical analysis amongst other hallmark skills. Ben successfully completed a placement year with HP. He has a great positive attitude and without a doubt, Ben has a very bright future ahead of him. ”",
        "Neil Pursell “Ben was a great addition to my team and to HP. His 13 month placement flashed past but Ben was keen and enthusiastic to be involved, to learn, to support and to lead. He demonstrated a maturity in the way he quickly adjusted to life at a big corporate company and was responsible with tasks that he was asked to be involved in. Watching Ben develop whilst supporting different members of the team and areas of the business was fantastic and allowed him to learn new skills and gain new experiences and always demonstrating his positivity and eagerness to progress. It was great to work alongside Ben and I wish him luck in his next adventures as a markerter. ”"
