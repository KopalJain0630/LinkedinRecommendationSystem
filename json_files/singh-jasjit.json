        "Kamran Iqbal ‚ÄúI had a great opportunity to learn social entrepreneurship from Dr. J as a part of my coursework at INSEAD. He is a great teacher and a mentor with depth, breadth, and expertise in social entrepreneurship. He speaks from the place of humility, authenticity, great quality of sense of humor, and candor and it helps improve people taught by him. He is always full of energy, focus, attention, and passion which inspires the person for the same. I feel lucky to have him as my mentor and my teacher. For anyone looking to create social impact, I highly recommend Dr. J as the best source of learning and building social entrepreneurial practice. Thank you, Dr. J! ‚Äù",
        "Claire Yan ‚ÄúI cannot thank Dr. J enough for helping me to clarify my understanding about impact business. His lecture in INSEAD on social entrepreneurship is not only clear but also engaging and fun. For anyone who wants to learn more about social entrepreneur or impact business, INSEAD is THE PLACE to go because of Dr. J.‚Äù"
