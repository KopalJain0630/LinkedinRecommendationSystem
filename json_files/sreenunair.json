He is one of the most honest, transparent recruiters I've met in my career. Throughout the process, he has given me detailed and timely feedback as well as insights into the hiring process and culture at Slice. One of the few things I've cherished is the fact that we were able to have open conversations regarding the company culture, work life balance, mission and vision and all important parameters which one needs before choosing a new role. I would highly recommend Sreenu for being a highly genuine and professional Recruiter.”",
