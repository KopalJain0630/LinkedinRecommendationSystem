He began as every other young chap with abundant energy and enthusiasm but a lot of chinks in the fundamental thought process but what set him apart was his willingness to understand his bottlenecks and possess the drive to work on them dedicatedly and persevere till he got results I closely mentored him for over a year on multiple aspects like team management, technology, sales, people management, work structuring etc. It's great to see his progress over these years as an entrepreneur wearing multiple hats. He has developed good fundamental understanding of the different aspects of running a tech startup. His resilience, passion & focus as an entrepreneur is commendable. I've seen & advised him during some of the toughest phases. I'm proud to see the way he tackled these situations with calm & rational mind and came out stronger. It's heartwarming to see Saad & Serri reaching new milestones. I wish Saad all the best for his future endeavours! He earns highest recommendation as an entrepreneur & young leader.” Show less"
