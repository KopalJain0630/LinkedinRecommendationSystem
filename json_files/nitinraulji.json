Replaces fossil fuels.\",\"start_date\":\"May 2021\",\"description\":\"Welding / Brazing of Copper wires is an important process in electrical manufacturing industry. Copper with Copper or with some other metal is joined / fused for making an electrical connection.Conventionally fossil fuels like Acetylene or LPG with Oxygen are used as fuel. Mixture of Hydrogen + Oxygen generated from water using electrolysis, has proven to be superior fuel than fossil fuels. The supply chain and storage challenges are completely eliminated as the Hydroxy fuel is generated on-demand.Under AquaWelder project we undertake design, development , prototyping and manufacturing of machines for joining variety of metals like copper, mild steel, Brass,, stainless steel using brazing process. Our prototypes are successfully working at Thermocouple manufacturing and Electrical Motor manufacturing industry. #AquaWelder has totally replaced #fossil fuel and #carbon emissions is zero making the working environment cleaner and safer.\"},{\"title\":\"HyPulJet - The integrated Hydrogen Power unit.\",\"start_date\":\"Feb 2021\",\"description\":\"HyPulJet is startup company based in Derby, UK.We plan to develop an innovative engine that use Hydrogen as fuel and act as a generator for electric vehicles. It will be a low cost Green alternative to fuelcells and batteries with Zero CO2 and zero NOx.\"},{\"title\":\"Hydrogen for Waste2Energy\",\"start_date\":\"May 2020\",\"description\":\"#Hydrogen aids #Waste2Energy process..Hydroxy #FuelCell System developed by #HyEnergy was recently supplied to #Germany for a #Waste2Energy project to help reduce emissions from an incinerator. In the next phase, we shall take up aiding Pyrolysis and gassification process with the aim to reduce and if possible replace #fossil fuel consumption and #carbon emissions.\"},{\"title\":\"NG + OxyHydrogen fueled Power Generator\",\"start_date\":\"Oct 2019\",\"description\":\"Designed and Developed OxyHydrogen Genrator for NG fueled Power Generator to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, for a German buyer.
