        "Satyam Mehra “I worked with Parthasarthy on 2 projects over several months at Bain. I was the manager on the projects and Parthasarathy was the lead consultant. Partha is a great consultant; a very motivated and result oriented person; and a human being with very high ethics and commitment. On the projects we worked together on, Partha assumed great responsibility, did zero-defect analyses and worked closely with multiple clients and team members. He can both dive deep into analytics as well as step back and engage on the bigger picture. I believe Partha would be an asset to any organization.”"
