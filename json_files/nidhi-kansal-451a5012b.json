Retired Navy Officer, Late Shri Ramnath Yadav, a true visionary was a very kind-hearted person who served others before himself. He spent his entire life in serving to the Nation and his vision to see a developed India became a question when he passed away in November 2014. Looking at this, the founders pledged to carry his vision forward with full spirits so that they can fulfil his dreams in his absence as well. This finally led to the formation of the Pragyata Foundation which is now one of the most hardworking organisations for a great social cause.Pragyata Foundation is a registered Non-Profit Organisation which has been conducting activities for the security of human rights, promotion and protection of child rights, women empowerment, education, health and welfare programs, awareness workshops and the MDG's with complete determination.Established in October 2015, the foundation has events being organised keeping various aspects in mind.In fact some projects on a personal level started even before the establishment of the foundation on small scales which have been continued successfully since June, 2015. Soon after, now we have the opportunity to formally take our plans ahead with full support and guidance of other organisations.I have done lot of project with this ngo in various field and have actively participated on work shops and other orientation program.\n            \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show less",
