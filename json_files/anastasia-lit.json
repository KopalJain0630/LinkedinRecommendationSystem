        "‚ÄúI had a chance to work closely with Anastasia during several projects at Disruptive Foresight. We employed Anastasia as a part-time freelancer to perform a valuation analysis and build a strong investment portfolio based on our foresight models. Anastasia perfectly complemented our foresight competences with deep knowledge in general finance and investments. She used both fundamental and technical analysis to test our models, select companies, and structure balanced portfolios for our clients, based on their particular needs and demands. Anastasia possesses excellent analytical skills and practical experience in different fields of business. She works perfectly well on her own, as well as a part of a team. She does not double under pressure and never shies away from responsibilities and challenges. I strongly believe, the Anastasia will be a great asset to any company she decides to work for, and I recommend her without any reservation. ‚Äù Show less"
