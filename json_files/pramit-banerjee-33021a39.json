It included collaborating with multiple third party organisations (group of funding agencies, management consulting firm, specialist organisation, media houses, etc.). DIB being a novel mechanism of social financing, I was given the responsibility to disseminate the knowledge on DIB to internal stakeholders (on-ground team, finance team, HR Team, Marketing team, Assessment team, Fundraising team) of the organisation.",

Being a person brimming with ideas related to social development & a strong educational background of economics, Pramit also stood out with achievable solutions and has always been a great team player. His easy-going nature, ability to convince & motivate others are mention-worthy and he's quite capable of being a great leader, supporting & encouraging everyone for growth. Over the years, I've seen him hone his skills in different work areas related to program strategy, philanthropy advisory, fundraising strategy, and communications.
