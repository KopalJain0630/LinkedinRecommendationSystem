The primary goal is to enable the quadruped robot, Cerberus, to autonomously learn and execute locomotion with minimal engineering intervention, achieved by mapping sensory inputs to low-level actions through DRL.Designed as a quadruped with 12 Degrees of Freedom (DOF), Cerberus features four legs, each with three joints and servo motors. The computational core, Jetson Nano, runs multiple neural networks. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from OpenAI Gym trains the AI agent in a 3D simulation with Pybullet. The learned policy transitions seamlessly to the physical Cerberus.The gyroscope sensor, positioned at the base, calibrates the robot. An accelerometer detects disturbances, feeding into a balancing algorithm that adjusts joint values for stability. A secure web app serves as the user interface, allowing remote control and commanding Cerberus to initiate motion, adjust speed, and stop.Key Functions:User Interaction: Web app enables user registration, login, and remote control of Cerberus.Robot Locomotion: Cerberus walks forward on command, with adjustable speed.Balancing Capability: The robot autonomously recovers from external forces, maintaining stability.Web-Based Control: Users initiate motion, adjust speed, and halt robot movement through a secure portal.\"},{},{\"title\":\"Particle Physics Simulator\",\"description\":\"Developed a Particle Physics Simulation leveraging CUDA, OpenCL and PyOpenGL, demonstrating gravitational interactions among particles.
