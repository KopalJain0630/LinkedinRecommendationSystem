With a good understanding of the on-ground operational issues that we face when solving a huge problem of digitizing everyday public transport commuting, he has shown great foresight to accordingly build a Marketing plan and consumer product touch points which helps ensure consumers have the ideal experience on the app. I think his behaviour in such situations also highlights his biggest strength of ensuring all sections of the organization were in sync with each other and there were no communication gaps, showcasing his ability to get everyone to pull in the same direction and potential as a future industry leader, who has earned my trust to lead and deliver on complex work assignments.”",
        "Saahil Narang “Ayush played an important role in setting up transactions department at Ridlr. He is fondly called as the \"Rocket Singh\" at Ridlr for achieving high growth metrics. He is a very good generalist and has handled functions across - marketing, product and even operations. He performs every task with complete dedication and focus and is a well-respected leader at Ridlr. Its a pleasure to work with him in the same team and I highly recommend him for entrepreneurial/ leadership positions in high risk projects.”"
