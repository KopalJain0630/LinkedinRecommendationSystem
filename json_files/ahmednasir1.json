Ahmed has strong knowledge about backend systems and has a good grip over a variety of technologies. Ahmed is always helpful toward others and wanted everyone under his supervision to grow. He always responded to my queries right away, came up with optimal solutions, and even follows up later in the week or month to make sure my issues have been resolved. Ahmed's work ethic and knowledgeable contribution in discussions always inspired me to do the best job I can. I would highly recommend Ahmed.”",
        "Amir Ali “Ahmed is probably the most inspiring person that I know of. He has played a pivotal role as a mentor and helped me in my career transition from DBA to backend development. Despite a short tenure, I learned a lot from him. I really admire the way he manages the team, providing enough freedom to do the work and at the same time making sure that your work is recognized and is being appreciated. I enjoyed our professional and personal conversations, he really helped me to think from many angles. He is a very humble and supportive person. He would be a valuable asset to any company. I hope that our paths cross in the future.”"
