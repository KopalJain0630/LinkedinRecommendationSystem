He has been an academic achiever. It has been a complete delight to see Manan grow from a quiet, reserved student to a confident professional who voices his opinion without the fear of being judged. A self-motivated student, he strives to excel in all his academic endeavours. He has always been extremely helpful, respectful and humble and a valuable asset to the institution. And I am sure he will be a great asset to any team he joins! Wishing him the very best in his career ahead! ”",
        "Meena Desai “I have witnessed Manan's journey for the last 5 years as a student of the UG and PG programs at ISME. His ability to take people along, hunger to learn and maintain a humble approach are some of his key characteristics. Manan will definitely create value in the many hats he will wear now as he steps out into the corporate world. Wishing you great success ”"
