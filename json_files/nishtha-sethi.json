        "Akanksha Pragya ‚ÄúThough Nishtha and I have been in different teams of the same organization (BloodConnect), most of our interaction has occurred outside the organizational space. And I could say, with utmost conviction, that Nishtha will be the most hard-working, initiative-taking yet most humble person in any room of people I can ever walk in. She multi-tasks (and excels too!) as smoothly as she maintains her patience and composure. She laid foundations to the Alumni Relations Cell at her college. She started her #WannaBeVC page for aspiring enterpreneurs and fellow economics/finance enthusiasts, to help them quench their questions in this field. Both of these did not exist before. One thing that Nishtha is NOT is that she is NOT a bellyarcher ‚Äì it is almost like she is complaint-blind and solution-maniac. She might not have all the solutions but she will know how to turn all the relevant stones upside down to lead her self to the solution or at least as close as it is possible. I wish her great success in all her endeavors. And I hope, in addition to her utterly astonishing accomplishments, she is able to induce some somnolence-skills into herself!‚Äù",
        "Sambhav Gupta ‚ÄúNishtha is one of the most focused person I have ever met. The thing I liked about her is she is not a multitasker, she believes in doing one thing at one go which results in enhancing the work. She is always ahead in taking initiatives which gives her an edge over others. She keeps track of the success of her fellow beings and never forgets to appreciate them for their achievements. She also identifies the shortcoming in one's work and helps them to do better and lead them toward growth.‚Äù"
