        "John Klepper ‚ÄúI wholeheartedly recommend Alex for his outstanding leadership skills, organizational skills and for his authentic, kind, caring personality that resonates through everything he does. I first got to know Alex through the Oxfo Foundry accelerator program which my company was accepted into. During this program he expertly curated an impressive network of mentors, advisors and investors for our business, resulting in invaluable guidance and support as well as commitments from investors. Specific areas of advice and support we received from him included; go-to-market strategies, funding strategies, pitch deck refinement, business models, product positioning, pricing, and sales strategies. Alex's dedication to our success, both personally and professionally, was unwavering. He consistently went above and beyond, willingly putting in extra time and effort whenever needed. His exceptional dedication and efforts made a significant impact on our growth and development and I cannot thank him enough for his guidance, his support and his friendship. Alex is a rare gem that will go far in life, of that I have no doubt!‚Äù"
