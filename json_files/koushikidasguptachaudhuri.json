This topic has become more popular due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19 disease. A comorbid condition due to multiple concurrent diseases is more fatal than a single disease. These comorbid conditions can be caused due to different genetic as well as drug-related side effects on an individual. There are already successful methods for predicting comorbid disease associations. This disease-associated genetic or drug-invasive information can help infer more target factors that cause common diseases. This may further help find out effective drugs for treating a pair of concurrent diseases. In addition to that, the common drug side-effects causing a disease phenotype and the gene associated with that can be helpful in finding important biomarkers for further prognosis of the comorbid disease. In this paper, we use the knowledge graph (KG) from our previous study to find out target-specific relations apart from sole disease-disease associations. We use four different heterogeneous graph neural network models to perform link prediction among different entities in the knowledge graph and we perform a comparative analysis among them. It is found that our best heterogeneous GNN model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on a few target-specific relationships. Further, we also predict a few novel drug-disease, drug-phenotype, disease-phenotype, and gene-phenotype associations. These interrelated associations are further used to find out the common phenotypes associated with a comorbid disease as well as caused by the direct side effects of a treating drug. In this regard, our methodology also predicts some novel biomarkers and therapeutics for different fatal prevalent diseases.\"},{\"title\":\"A hybrid extreme learning machine model with harris hawks optimisation algorithm: an optimised model for product demand forecasting applications\",\"subtitle\":\"Applied Intelligence, Springer\",\"date\":\"January 26, 2022\",\"description\":\"Accurate and real-time product demand forecasting is the need of the hour in the world of supply chain management. Predicting future product demand from historical sales data is a highly non-linear problem, subject to various external and environmental factors. In this work, we propose an optimised forecasting model - an extreme learning machine (ELM) model coupled with the Harris Hawks optimisation (HHO) algorithm to forecast product demand in an e-commerce company. ELM is preferred over traditional neural networks mainly due to its fast computational speed, which allows efficient demand forecasting in real-time. Our ELM-HHO model performed significantly better than ARIMA models that are commonly used in industries to forecast product demand. The performance of the proposed ELM-HHO model was also compared with traditional ELM, ELM auto-tuned using Bayesian Optimisation (ELM-BO), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based recurrent neural network and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network models. Different performance metrics, i.e., Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Percentage Error (MPE) were used for the comparison of the selected models. Horizon forecasting at 3 days and 7 days ahead was also performed using the proposed approach. The results revealed that the proposed approach is superior to traditional product demand forecasting models in terms of prediction accuracy and it can be applied in real-time to predict future product demand based on the previous week‚Äôs sales data. In particular, considering RMSE of forecasting, the proposed ELM-HHO model performed 62.73% better than the statistical ARIMA(7,1,0) model, 40.73% better than the neural network based GRU model, 34.05% better than the neural network based LSTM model, 27.16% better than the traditional non-optimised ELM model with 100 hidden nodes and 11.63% better than the ELM-BO model in forecasting product demand for future 3 months.\"},{\"title\":\"Size Optimization for Intent Analysis in Voice Commanding \",\"subtitle\":\"Short Paper Track at MLADS-Synapse 2020, Microsoft‚Äôs ML, AI and Data Science Conference\",\"date\":\"Jul 2020\",\"description\":\"Voice technology is getting more and more ubiquitous and with that, the need for it to work always. In this technology, a major highlight is to incorporate voice commanding in an application on a device. This suffers inaccuracies at two levels, firstly the conversion of the user's speech command to text and secondly classification of the underlying intent from this text. This twofold process is presently either done completely On-server limiting the functionality to only when user is online or incorporates two Deep Learning models leaving behind huge memory footprints in the app. In this work, we show how this problem can be solved by training only a single size optimized Intent classifier covering up the inaccuracies incurred by the device offline speech recognizer. A quantitative size comparison is first shown between various existing Machine Learning and Deep Learning Intent Classifier Models followed by an end to end implementation of this in Microsoft Word App.\"}]",
