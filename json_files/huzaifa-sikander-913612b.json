        "Sarah Ahmad ‚ÄúI have known Huzaifa as a professional, a creative, a co worker, and a friend. He has exceeded my expectations always and that's just the kind of person he is. He likes being the best at what ever role it is he is playing in your life. His shoes are always very difficult to fill and I am sure I would have many heads nodding when they read this. He is the first \"genuine creative\" I have come across in the corporate world. Huzaifa knows how to create that perfect balance between working hard and taking it easy and that's why he is as great a team player as he is a Manager. I wish him all the best in life may he always shine.‚Äù",
        "Ali Hassan ‚ÄúAbsolutely Amazing personality! When it comes to managing people, Huzaifa has the required skills. With his unique upbeat approach, he tackles any situation that comes his way.... a mentor, coach and a great person ...... definitely an asset to our company.‚Äù"
