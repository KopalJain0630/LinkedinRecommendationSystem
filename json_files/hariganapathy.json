        "Ashwin Shekhar ‚ÄúI have worked with Hari for about 5 months from august to December . It has been a real pleasure working with Hari . He has been a source of guidance and support through out the 5 months. His style of working is immaculate and has the knack of getting things done . Under his leadership I have learnt a lot on how to deal with people and difficult situations . He also has helped my sharpen my skills to become a better sales manager with tips and examples on how to do it right along the way. As a manager he has been constantly on the ball never losing sight of the goal and has kept us motivated even when things where gloomy. He has also taught us to celebrate small achievements and take pride in what we have achieved. It been a pleasure working with him . Look forward to working with you again somewhere down the line.‚Äù",
        "Amit Doshi ‚ÄúHari is a fast learner - alert, curious and probing. He worked with me during his Management Trainee sting in Marketing. Faced with a white space problem, Hari demonstrated a unique ability to understand consumers and more importantly, distill it all to articulate compelling platforms - well beyond his years at that time. He is a true team worker willing to push that extra mile and can be relied upon to deliver high quality output. A dear pal - looking forward to jamming with him again.‚Äù"
