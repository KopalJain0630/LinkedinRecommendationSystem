        "Sabyasachi Das ‚ÄúI have known Rupesh since last 2 and a half years. We studied MBA at Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB) together. Rupesh possesses exceptional team management, planning and execution skills. We have been part of numerous live projects, assignments and other co-curricular activities in the campus, and i have indeed learnt a lot from him. He is a person whom you can assign any responsibility and can be rest assured that it would be completed to perfection. He was instrumental in taking our rural marketing fair - Gramotsava and Rural Managers' Association of XIMB (RMAX) to greater heights during his tenure. He possesses tremendous networking skills. His deft handling of various organizations, students, professors, college authorities, logistics and other stake holders ensured that we delivered quality work for our organizations who participated in Gramotsava and gave us various live projects. He is sure asset and star in any team. I'm sure with his professionalism, leadership, hard-work and perseverance he would touch even greater heights of success in the coming years.‚Äù",
        "Samveet Sahoo ‚ÄúRupesh is an aggressive learner. He has worked on different rural marketing events and market research projects. The amount of clarity and perfection in his work is commendable. Handling teams and reaching the goal has been his ultimate motto. He has successfully implemented BTL activities for projects from top MNC's. I wish him all the luck and hardwork for the future.‚Äù"
