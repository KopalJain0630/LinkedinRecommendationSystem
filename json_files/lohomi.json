His eye for detail and his work ethic were standout features for me. He was always enthusiastic about taking up new and challenging tasks and coming up with trumps. I am sure that he would be a great asset to any organization that he would be a part of. I have no hesitation to recommend Parth to his future employers and will highly vouch for Parth as he sets off on his career journey. Wishing him nothing but the best”",
