Driver fatigue causes 1000s of deaths every year. The objective of our hack was to prevent these deaths by providing an alert to the driver whenever they doze off.The solution contains the following elements- An Android Application that has access to the Front (Selfie) camera in your phone- When turned-ON the application can either run on the foreground or as a service- The App would randomly capture images of the driver every 10s. - Using OpenCV for Android, we detect the position and state of the eye- If the eye is closed, the app would immediately trigger an alarm - A loud beep sound- The application can also be paired with smart watches (Pebble) to give a buzzing alert to the driver.This application makes sense as many people mount their smartphones in a dock to act as a Navigation assistant.\"},{}]",
