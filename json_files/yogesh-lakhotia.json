Apart from his academics and certifications, his CV is enriched with a lot of corporate exposure in the form of corporate work experience, internships, specifically the summer one, and various other live projects. His involvement in various positions of responsibilities as part of different committees in KJSIM and his participation in co-curricular activities makes him an all round and well developed personality, which reflected in the GDPI training and evaluation process. I am confident that he will make the grade for any reputed corporate during the initial phases of his final placement process and I wish him the very best for the same. ”",
