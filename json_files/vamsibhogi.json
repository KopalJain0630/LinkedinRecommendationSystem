        "Renganathan Subramanian “I was a business development intern at Real Tycoon. As a first time intern with zero knowledge of the subject or of a workspace, I found an ideal mentor in Vamsi. He possesses a no nonsense attitude. This is crucial in a booming startup with a mark to earn. His unique outlook of dispensing work to interns, based not solely on the company needs but on the intern's goals and future utility, instigates the interns to work for themselves. This increases the efficacy of the work and proves advantageous for the company too.”"
