The method employed a combination of point coordinate and doppler values obtained from the point cloud data of the radars. Target identification is done using DBSCAN, the largest cluster in a frame being identified as the subject. A novel heuristic-based algorithm was proposed to detect fall events, where a fall event is classified as the subject falling down on the ground and remaining there for a certain amount of time. We conducted experiments in various fall and non-fall scenarios with different subjects and the results provided fall detection rate of 80% for LoS cases and 88% for NLoS cases when two radars are used, while maintaining a false alarm rate of just 23% for non-falls.\"},{},{},{},{\"title\":\"Personalized Hotel Recommender using Sentiment Analysis\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2022\",\"end_date\":\"Dec 2022\",\"description\":\"Used both supervised (Multi-class Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine) and Unsupervised (KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM), and Hierarchical Clustering) learning algorithms to recommend hotels based on user aspect and past reviews.
