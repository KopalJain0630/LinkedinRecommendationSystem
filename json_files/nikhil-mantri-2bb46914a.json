Why do they have to look after their previous medical records and carry files every time they visit a doctor. With this thought in mind, I started a personal project to make an app to enable patients to take appointments with doctors from home, and enable doctors to directly add the prescriptions and notes for the patient to our cloud which can be viewed by the patient and edited by the doctor. Since this uses Firebase database, all a patient needs is an android device to sign in and he can view his records and take appointments from anywhere, not to mention how much this will help in social distancing.I and my friend Mohit Bohra came up with this app for a multi-speciality hospital in my hometown and I am happy to announce that soon they will be distributing this app to the locals and releasing it on PlayStore.Here is the source code on my github handle. Feel free to reuse it and submit PRs!\"},{\"title\":\"FlyingDestroyer\",\"start_date\":\"Mar 2020\",\"end_date\":\"May 2020\",\"description\":\"This is my first Android game!
