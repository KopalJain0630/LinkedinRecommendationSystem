        "LinkedIn User “I had the pleasure of working with Krishna in connection with the sale of Integreon to a new private equity investor, where he acted as a financial advisor to Integreon's former majority investor. Krishna was key to helping the parties navigate through complex deal points, often proposing creative solutions that helped us bridge gaps in negotiating positions. He took the time to understand all deal dynamics, financial, operational and legal, and was instrumental in moving the process forward to closure. It was an incredible effort given that we were coordinating old and new investors and company execs located in the US, UK, Hong Kong, Philippines and India. I hope to have the opportunity to work with Krishna again and recommend him highly. ”",
        "Dick Cohen “Krishna is one of the smartest people I have had the privilege of working with. We worked on several private equity transactions I was responsible for at BofA and I enjoyed our working relationship tremendously. I always found Krishna's judgment to be on the mark, his intelligence invaluable in trying to solve problems, and his demeanor on the job and off a pleasure. I would recommend Krishna without reservation and hope to work with him again in the near future.”"
