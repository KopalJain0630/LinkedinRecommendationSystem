        "“Pratik is unarguably one of the best people that I have ever worked with. Anyone who has worked with him (or has read his blogs), probably already knows that he is an excellent problem solver with awesome quantitative aptitude. But what makes him extraordinary are his two rare super-powers: 1.> He is always, ALWAYS learning. Whenever he is talking to anyone, irrespective of his relationship with that person, he is always looking to learn more. This means that he is scaling his skill set (and by extension himself), faster than almost anyone else that I know. 2.> He has an uncanny ability of making people feel good about themselves. This has dual affect; one that the person himself / herself does better because of the extra motivation and second that they are a lot more likely to trust and help Pratik, thus helping him build a large and valuable network. If he can hold on to his super-powers, I believe we have a superman to look out for in whatever field he chooses to work in.” Show less",
        "“Pratik is a rare talent among all the people I have hired and led. It would be silly to talk about Pratik's prowess in Math and CS - those are obvious from his credentials and from the quality of his technical work. What makes him special is his versatility - strong communication skills, professionalism and discipline in his work (rare among the people I have led), sound social and emotional intelligence, and most importantly, a keen desire to always learn, broaden and improve. A special quality about Pratik is that he can instantly light up a gathering of people (and I am talking work) with his gregarious personality and genuine affection. Given all that he possesses, I think he would make a great entrepreneur.” Show less"

In this paper, we explore a factorization-based approach called Near-Factorization that can be used in conjunction with existing optimization techniques such as Window NAF (Non Adjacent Form). We present a performance model of Near-Factorization and validate model results with those from a simulation. We compare Near-Factorization with w-NAF for a range of scalar sizes, window sizes, divisor lengths and Hamming weights of divisor. The use of Near-Factorization with w-NAF results in a considerable reduction in the effective Hamming weight of the scalar and a reduction in overall computation cost for Koblitz curves.\"}]",
