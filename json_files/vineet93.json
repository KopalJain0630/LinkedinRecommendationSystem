        "Prateek M. ‚ÄúVineet is a very quick learner and has insatiable hunger to learn and do more. He was able to understand and execute complex tasks relatively quickly and became an obvious choice for leading new time sensitive and critical projects for the desk. Vineet has the right working attitude and a good balance of business and quantitative skills. His role not only required good time management and communication skills, but also required regularly working under pressure and time critical situations where he excelled. He is also a good team player as he worked in a team where there was little to no intervention from the team manager and the team had to distribute tasks themselves. ‚Äù",
        "Prabhat Mehta ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of working with Vineet for almost two years at the J.P. Morgan, collaborating on several project teams. Vineet‚Äôs ability to handle multiple projects was unlike any I‚Äôve seen before and made a dramatic increase in the productivity level of our team. He was very quick at catching up with the team‚Äôs framework and tools and in no time started contributing as well. He is dedicated and makes continued effort to improve. He would often go an extra mile and work alternate solutions for clients/team and discuss if anything can be further improved. As a team member, Vineet earns my highest recommendation. ‚Äù"
