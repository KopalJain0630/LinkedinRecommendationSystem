        "James Fort “I had the pleasure of working with Nidhi as an intern on our team at Unity in the AI organization over the summer of 2020. Nidhi showed excellent initiative during her time here. She was able to take ownership of a very early stage project idea and drive it through to an actionable strategy for our organization in a new space. She was able to quickly come up to speed on a rapidly changing technology area, identify the relevant market sub-segments, work with stakeholders to source prospects, lead detailed technical discovery calls, and distill discovery learnings into an actionable strategy that she presented quite effectively at the VP level. I was impressed by her ability to both define this new customer segment and understand how our core technologies help in this area in such a short timeframe. I highly recommend her as a product manager in a technical space and believe that she has very high potential to grow as she progresses through her career.”",
        "Kevin Saito “Had the pleasure of managing Nidhi during her internship at Unity. During her time here she had to quickly ramp up on the nature of B2B customer discovery and pull together a research project to help us identify whether we should enter an adjacent market segment. After a considerable amount of work her final project was very well received by our SVP and was deemed \"excellent\" and will likely lead to a change in our plans.”"
