A testament to her creative prowess and leadership was the time she conceptualized a Mother's Day campaign on TikTok. The campaign generated a whopping 4.3 billion views, created a major PR buzz, and was recognized as the 'Best Viral Marketing Campaign' at the Masters of Modern Marketing Awards 2019. But what makes Nupur stand out is not just her creativity. She's also one of those rare creative minds that understands business.
