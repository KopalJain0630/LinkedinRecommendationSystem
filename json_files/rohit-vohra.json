I also organized a few events during that period such as “ANTI DRUG CAMPAIGN” and “ROTARACT KI GANDHIGIRI”. Organizing these events and being an active participant of the rest provided me with priceless exposure and experience of marketing management at a basic level. Working with my team, I publicized our events to encompass as much crowd as I could for our events. I handled the distribution of brochures, pamphlets, posters etc. at various places such as markets, parks, malls, clubs, restaurants, hangout spots, colleges etc. The major segment included colleges where I interacted with their administration regarding permission to operate in their campuses as well as the students to make them aware of our events, communicate the value which those events will offer to them and convince them to be a part of it. I handled the selling of passes through which I gained experience of sales and persuasion.",
