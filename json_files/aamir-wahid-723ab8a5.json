            "description": "A first of its kind in GCC, nonprofit student organization dedicated to those with a keen interest in financial markets and investments. Our primary goal is to create an open environment where students across disciplines can exchange ideas freely and extend the knowledge base of our members.Student Investment clubs have been a part of business schools for the last 30 years in the UK and the US. They provide a powerful learning framework and bridge formal and practical training for aspiring finance professionals. Clubs offer an informal setting where freshmen and sophomores can begin to build a knowledge base. Those who do not go on to major in finance will have learned valuable skills for investing and managing their own money. Those who go on to major in finance will have built a solid foundation for upper division finance courses especially if investment club activities are coupled with a course in personal finance. Investment clubs are also an excellent vehicle for keeping alumni in touch with their alma mater. Alumni advantage because they can continue to participate in an activity that they enjoy, students benefit because they can network with alumni, and schools benefit from increased interaction with alumni. We strive to provide a perfect unconventional teaching and learning experience that lasts beyond the duration of a student's academic career.Our vision : a portfolio that is solely managed by members with the aim of giving them a live experience of managing a fund. They become deeply involved in the pursuit of new investment possibilities. Discussions of past investment successes and failures help students develop their knowledge. Such interaction creates a wonderful informal environment where students can learn a great deal about finance and have fun in the process.",
