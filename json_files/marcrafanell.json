To doso, we look both at historical backgroundand compare the 1980s crisis with the current situation (Section 2). We also question thevaluation models employed, researching some alternatives and explaining its implications(Section 3). With the aim to further understand the complexity of irrational behaviors inmarkets, we describe the three main categories of bubbles and fads (Section 4). Finally, wecarry an empirical analysis, looking at the descriptive statistics of the main factorsinfluencing farmland values and their evolution during the last two decades, as well asexamining an OLS regression model that uses Illinois farmland data to check for evidence infavor of the existence of an irrational bubble (Section 5).All in all, we conclude that there is no evidence to claim for the existence of an irrationalbubble. Nonetheless, we believe that the U.S. Farmland market might be immersing in agrowing rational bubble, supported by the expected profitability of its underlying economicdeterminants. That still should be handled with caution by regulators and investors since aswitch in some independent factors could dramatically change the agricultural real estatevalues, and that would have important consequences on the economic performance of manyfarmers and landlords.\"},{\"title\":\"Sistema Espanyol de Pensions (Catalan)\",\"date\":\"May 2011\",\"description\":\"\\\"I en aquest context, l‚Äôaugment de la esperancÃßa de vida eÃÅs un gran assoliment; i alhora, financÃßar jubilacions llargues, un gran repte.\\\"\"}]",
