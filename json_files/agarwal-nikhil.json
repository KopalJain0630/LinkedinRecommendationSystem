        "Supriya Patnaik ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of being mentored by Nikhil during my time at GGI, where he served as a lead Tech instructor. Nikhil is an exceptional educator with a deep understanding of programming concepts and a knack for making complex topics easy to grasp. His ability to break down difficult Python concepts into simple, understandable lessons was incredibly valuable to me. Nikhil's teaching style is both engaging and practical, ensuring that we not only understood the theory behind Python but also how to apply it in real-world scenarios. He was always patient, approachable, and willing to go the extra mile to ensure that all of his students succeeded. His passion for technology and his genuine desire to help others learn were evident in every class. I highly recommend Nikhil to anyone looking to deepen their technical knowledge, He is truly one of the best instructors I have had the privilege of learning from.‚Äù",
