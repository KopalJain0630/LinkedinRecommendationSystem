He is a true professional who is very honest and committed to the task at hand. He worked on a variety of projects ranging from complex market analysis to short turnaround rapid research requests and delivered equally well across the spectrum. Anshul is also a very good mentor and coach for the team reporting to him. He always has the interest of his team at his heart and is willing to do whatever it takes to bring out the best in everyone in his team. Because of this reason he commanded a lot of respect and trust from his team members.
