        "Pratyush Rai ‚ÄúAbhishek is a standout go-getter. I had the pleasure to work with him as the first-ever Chief Secretary of President of Students' Gymkhana. In simple terms, he managed shops (ex: fulfilled 6+ major longstanding promises on new shops), important infrastructure committees (ex: worked very closely with Dean of Infra & Planning), organized key student events (ex: successfully managed a safe treasure hunt for freshers amid various anti-ragging regulations). He also led a team of 20+ individuals at different times to execute important matters of the Presidents' Office. Best thing I observed about him: Once you can inspire him to focus on something, he puts his heart & soul into it (goes \"all-in\" at a different level). He takes extreme ownership, thrives in doing work independently (at times to a fault), & is very purpose-driven. He is also very lively outside work. He is definitely going to be an ultimate asset on any purpose-driven team. I highly recommend Abhishek if you need to get the job done!‚Äù"
