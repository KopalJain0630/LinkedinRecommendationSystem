My team and I attended an event hosted by her group in London, and Natalie's dedication, energy, and professionalism impressed us right away. Years later, we were fortunate enough to recruit Natalie to serve as a Senior Advisor to a new pan-European investment fund. Natalie's expansive network and relationships allowed us to gain significant traction with investors and family offices throughout Europe and the UK. Her expertise in social media, event planning, and organizing investor meetings has been invaluable. It is a joy to work with someone who has such a great work ethic, integrity, and principles.‚Äù",
