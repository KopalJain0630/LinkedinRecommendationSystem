        "“Tanishq has to be one of the smartest Product managers that I got to work with in Sprinklr. A genuinely talented out of the box thinker for whatever problem you throw at him. One of the most inspiring qualities in him is his curiosity. Being curious about any new tech, new projects, and new use cases helped him come up with amazing ideas. While I was leading the Product Insights module, Tanishq managed the most important metric at hand - Retention. He would come up with new product ideas and POCs to keep this metric in check and did an amazing job at it. Tanishq not only excelled as an individual contributor, he was also directly managing four analysts under him. His clarity for them helped them generate their best individual outputs too. I wholeheartedly recommend Tanishq for any kind of projects, I am confident he will exceed expectations with whatever he picks up.” Show less",
        "“Tanishq is one of top performers in my team, who possessed outstanding product expertise with exceptional problem solving skill, a positive attitude towards any task was given to him. With a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of PM principles, he consistently exceeds expectations. Be it, wireframing, creating PRD and sample designs, he excels in all aspects. He effectively navigates complex projects, prioritizes tasks, and delivers on time. His strategic mindset and forward-thinking approach drive business growth. His professionalism, and willingness to support colleagues make him a pleasure to work with. Tanishq is an invaluable asset to any team, and I highly recommend him for product management roles in any organisation.” Show less"
