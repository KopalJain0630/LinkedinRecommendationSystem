        "Pradyot Anand “Arun and I have been associated through CrackVerbal. As a fellow GMAT mentor, I appreciate Arun's passion to teach, commitment to his students, and willingness to go beyond the strict boundaries of what is paid for / included in the \"course\". Having worked for 2 years as a faculty at CrackVerbal, I liked how Arun gave me the freedom to structure the classes as I felt best and also his appreciation and cross-pollination of ideas based on our different teaching styles. I'd unreservedly recommend Arun & CrackVerbal to both, prospective MBA candidates and part/full-time GMAT faculty.”",
        "Sreedhar Avula “Arun, a multi-faceted personality, chose the road less travelled and that decision not only helped but also paved a way to many of the MBA dreamers to travel through their own chosen less travelled paths. His simple yet very insightful interactions/sessions take the students with awe and help them reach their destinies of GMAT and B-school admissions with ease, which would otherwise be a not so easy task to many. He delivers the sessions with true spirit and adds a unique flavour to it with his innovation and humour touch. His passion and commitment is commendable and truly admirable, which adds great value to students and clients. I sincerely hope and trust that Arun reaches great heights in this field and sets new standards.”"
