        "Triin Agan “I’ve known Raja for several years now and ever since I first got to know her, I’ve kept an eye on her inspiring journey. She has always amazed me by her wisdom and well thought through knowledge she shares with her network of industry leaders. So when she called for applications to the Visionary Board program I knew right away that I want to participate as Raja delivers only high quality events. It exceeded all my expectations not only regarding the experts who were sharing their knowledge but also the network of people who had come together. I’m a huge fan of Raja’s work. ”",
        "Thom Berglund “In September, I had the privilege of participating in the Visionary Companies Board Training in the Netherlands. This inspiring three-day event featured exceptional speakers and engaged attendees, making it a truly enriching experience. I left the event with a deeper understanding of board dynamics and valuable frameworks that will enable me to contribute more effectively to my own board in the future. Additionally, we are currently seeking a Board Member to fill a gap in experience as we move forward with our internationalization efforts. I am thrilled to come away from these days not only with enhanced knowledge but also with two promising leads for potential board members. I wholeheartedly recommend this course and networking opportunity, as it exceeded my expectations thanks to Raja and the team!”"
