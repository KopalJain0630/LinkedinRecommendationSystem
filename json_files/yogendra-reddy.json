Methods/Statistical analysis: Analysis of Sensitivity in power losses in terms of DER's size and DER's siting has been performed by using Newton Raphson method. The proposed interconnected model gives efficient power transfer with respect to changes in power losses by solar power systems current injection in grid. Findings: After connecting multiple solar power systems to an electrical grid system, there by deciding the minimizing power losses and maximizing profit margin to increasing regulation and performance of the system. Simulation results shows the economical dispatch for final siting of solar power system as mentioned in IEEE 30 bus system and to operate within limits of voltages and currents ratings. Application/Improvements: In order to develop new solar power generation plant to interconnect electrical grid. Single line drawing of 2MW solar PV power plant added to 33 kV Nagaladinne feeder line Andhra Pradesh DISCOM, India. The whole distribution system network, and programs offered by governments has contributed to an increase in the number of distributed energy resources (DERs) in commercial and domestic electrical power generating units.\"},{\"title\":\"\\\"Optimization of Inrush Current in Electrical Transformer ”\",\"subtitle\":\"ICSEG-SEPTEMBER 2014,DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.2129.5846\",\"date\":\"September 19, 2014\",\"description\":\"\\\"Optimization of Inrush Current in Electrical Transformer ” ICSEG-SEPTEMBER2014,DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.2129.5846\"},{\"title\":\"Art Design novel cover page “X-Square (X Trilogy) (Volume 1)\",\"subtitle\":\"dp\",\"date\":\"September 19, 2013\",\"description\":\"Art Design novel cover page “X-Square (X Trilogy) (Volume 1) ByMr. Srinu Pandrank”i,ISBN:9781497482265\"},{\"title\":\"A Distribution Power Electronic Transformer for Medium Voltage Application\",\"subtitle\":\"NUICone 2012 –paper id 673 DOI 10.13140/RG.2.1.2141.8722\",\"date\":\"December 20, 2012\",\"description\":\"Published “A Distribution Power Electronic Transformer for Medium VoltageApplication” NUICone 2012 –paper id 673 DOI 10.13140/RG.2.1.2141.8722\"},{\"title\":\"A new light on renewable energy resources & building integrated photovoltaic\",\"subtitle\":\"ICES 2012 , DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.2391.7285\",\"date\":\"October 15, 2012\",\"description\":\"Published “A new light on renewable energy resources & building integratedphotovoltaic” ICES 2012 , DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.2391.7285\"},{\"title\":\"A modular power electronic transformer for medium voltage application\",\"subtitle\":\"-ICTEM-sept2012\",\"date\":\"September 6, 2012\",\"description\":\"Published “A modular power electronic transformer for medium voltageapplication” IEEE-173-ICTEM-sept2012\"},{\"title\":\"Power management and flow control of the micro grid connected in Hybrid system\",\"subtitle\":\"SCRTEEE-2012\",\"date\":\"August 13, 2012\",\"description\":\"Published “Power management and flow control of the micro grid connected inHybrid system”,SCRTEEE-2012\"},{\"title\":\"Integrated solar wall system with combined electricity and ventilation system\",\"subtitle\":\"RACE 2012,DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.4488.8807\",\"date\":\"June 8, 2012\",\"description\":\"Published “Integrated solar wall system with combined electricity andventilation system” RACE 2012,DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.4488.8807\"},{\"title\":\"Power management and flow control of the micro grid\",\"subtitle\":\"TRESAT-2012\",\"date\":\"February 17, 2012\",\"description\":\"Published “Power management and flow control of the micro grid “ISBN:978-81-922119-3-0,page 45,TRESAT-2012\"},{\"title\":\"INTEGRATED SOLAR WALL SYSTEM WITH COMBINED ELECTRICITY AND VENTILATION SYSTEM\",\"subtitle\":\"IEEE\"}]",
