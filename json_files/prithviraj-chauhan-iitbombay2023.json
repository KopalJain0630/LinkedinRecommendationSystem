    "about": "My passion for entrepreneurship and innovation has driven me to explore various start-ups and sectors through multiple internships, projects, and extracurricular activities. I have gained valuable experience in supply chain management at Safexpress, sustainability initiatives at IIM Bangalore, B2B sales and marketing at MaxedS, and construction at Rudra Enterprises. I have also mentored three teams in their entrepreneurial ventures as a teaching assistant at DS School of Entrepreneurship, IIT Bombay, where I managed the course logistics for 200+ students. Additionally, I have been an active member of NCC in my college, where I was awarded the prestigious DG NCC Commendation Award in 2022 for my leadership and discipline. I like to read books on military and learn from the strategies and tactics of the armed forces.",
