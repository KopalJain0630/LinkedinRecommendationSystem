He will be a guide if you feel lost, a Coach if you want to take next steps in your career and a critique if you set wrong expectations, just to bring you on the right path. I got in touch in Arun during the Covid times, when I was stuck in a unique situation back in India and wanted to work in Europe. His insights and experience helped me immensely to take right logical decisions to accelerate in my career. The best thing is Arun advises in the most honest way without any bias, assumption and completely based on facts, logic and his immense experience in the industry. After every conversation , you would learn something from him with a new perspective. Best wishes for future and kudos to Arun and the team at Career Development Group for all the great help and amazing work. ”",
        "Meiraj A.I. “ Arun is a very kind and intellectual professional. His strategic insight into talent and industries enabled me to develop better decisions, that has put me in the direction of growth. Now as a fellow professional, I believe growth has to be a commitment each one of us has to make up our minds on, if we're to take it seriously. Thank you for your time and consideration to review my CV and help me navigate through the obstacles, I have been experiencing. It was a very productive meeting and I learned a lot about optimizing my profile to specificity. Arun was so kind, patient, and supportive, our meeting has given me perspective on a lot of different things that I have to enable in order to engage within the German Job Market. The passion with which Arun guided me was the point of reference that I had been missing in my pursuit to accelerate my career. Professionals like Arun, who bring experience and most importantly passion to enable growth and change lives. He inspires me to carry this torch of changing lives in every professional domain I have with his support set to excel. Thank you, Arun and the team at Career Development Group for your patience, support, and commitment. All the best. ”"
