Perspective from Indian Stock Market\",\"subtitle\":\"Journal of Insurance and Financial Management\",\"description\":\"Portfolio managers and investors alike continuously grapple with trying to outperform the benchmarks, while keeping in mind the right number of stocks in the portfolio for optimal diversification. Through our analysis of the Indian stock market, we show that by random selection of stocks, the odds of outperforming the index are very low. Instead, if investors incorporate the ‘quality’ factor in stock selection, the probability of outperforming the index improves substantially and is statistically significant - at around 5% outperformance per annum at 90% confidence.By incorporating the quality factor, they can own a fairly small basket of 15 to 25 stocks, which captures 90% of the benefit of owning the benchmark at 90% confidence and generates strong outperformance compared to the index. This is much lower than the 45 stocks required for reducing only the diversifiable risk by 90% with a 90% confidence, as the previous studies suggest. These could serve as practical guidelines for portfolio construction and improving returns.\"}]",
