The Battery Management System is highly scalable as well as programmable and can be used for any Li ion cell chemistry irrespective of nominal cell voltage.I also designed the Protection Module for the battery pack which would provide protection to battery pack as well as Battery Management System against overcurrent, overvoltage and short circuit fault. I designed all the PCB layout for different modules of BMS myself.I am currently working on making the real time operating system (RTOS) of the vehicle using NXP K64 ARM based MCU.",
