        "Sandiip Bhammer ‚ÄúIn our interactions with EMotorad, Anjali consistently showcased unparalleled efficiency as the EMotorad Founder's Office Chief of Staff. Whether it was navigating complex queries or responding to our team's intricate demands, Anjali approached challenges with a blend of swift decisiveness and keen attention to detail. Her exemplary leadership skills were evident in every task she undertook, often setting the bar for promptness and precision. Equally impressive was Anjali's demeanour: always pleasant and radiating confidence. Every interaction with her was marked by her genuine enthusiasm and a can-do spirit. I wholeheartedly commend Anjali on her achievements at EMotorad and, as the Founder of Green Frontier Capital, I am convinced that she possesses the attributes to excel, irrespective of the industry or country she chooses to grace next. Best wishes, Anjali!‚Äù"
