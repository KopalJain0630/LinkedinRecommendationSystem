Shruti is one of the finest colleagues I have known through my professional career. She was one of the superstars on my team- reliable, meticulous, sharp, level headed, hardworking and diligent. Her pleasant personality and ease of handling work are her unique traits. She was not only a brilliant team member but also a great team player who helped her juniors come up the learning curve quickly. She always dealt with complex situations with utmost maturity and patience. Through her time on the team, she earned many accolades from her superiors and also many business leaders. Thank you for your immense contribution, Shruti and for being an amazing colleague and a great friend. Shruti will shine where ever she goes. My best wishes always!”"
