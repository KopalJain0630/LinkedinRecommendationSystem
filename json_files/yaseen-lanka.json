    "about": "An electronics engineer by choice, a system side programmer by love, entrepreneur by free will. Began my career by giving life to bare metal, worked in corporate world for 6+ years before jumping into entrepreneurship. Started my own company aimed at building products and solutions for home automation,  which failed – but it thought so much about the whole ecosystem of building business. Started a successful consumer brand '4Charge', which specialized in power banks and other mobile accessories. Was a consultant for start-ups, both tech and non-tech, including government projects towards achieving a smart city with automated street lighting and water meter solutions. Always up for writing code to get something done! Currently, building tech solutions at Hub71.",
