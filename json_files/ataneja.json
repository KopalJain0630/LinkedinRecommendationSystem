He helps you to build success in yourself and always pushes the bar on himself and his team. Its a lot of hardwork working for Ashish but a lot of fun too. I will not hesitate to work for him again.‚Äù",
        "Sreya Rakshit ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt very often that you come across a Leader in the corporate world who achieves the fine (and often elusive!) balance in being a thorough professional and an extraordinary human being. Ashish achieves that balance with great √©lan. Harboured deep in the philosophy of actions speak louder than words, Ashish allows his work to speak for himself. I consider myself deeply privileged to have had the opportunity to work with him. There are innumerable learnings that I have derived from my three year long association with Ashish but perhaps the one that is most deeply entrenched is that of authenticity. He has demonstrated by action, the importance of being authentic‚Ä¶ and with that he raised the bar higher than what it ever was at Vertex. I wish him the very best always.‚Äù"
