He has a great ability to bring in critical thoughts and perspectives to the discussion table and always adds a lot of value to the decision making process. Breaking down a problem and strategically tackling it with limited resources is something that naturally comes to him. I had a wonderful and enriching time working with him.”",
        "Nikunj Thakkar “I have rarely come across freshers with a clarity of thought, ambition and dedication to grow in the Venture Capital space. Shail certainly is one of them. During his two month stint in the Investment team of Artha Venture Fund, he had put in lot of hard work for timely delivering the tasks assigned to him. He displayed a positive outlook and curiosity towards new business models and sectors, which made him a good resource to have at work. Overall, I would recommend him for his positive attitude and ability to be a fast learner.”"
