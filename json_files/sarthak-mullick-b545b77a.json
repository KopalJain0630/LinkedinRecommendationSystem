Possessing deep technical expertise and an unmatched product and business acumen, his vast experience is only matched by his great personality, and problem solving mindset - which has led to the timely and seamless launch of various platform experiences which greatly influenced the success of Livspace's demand generation. I highly recommend Sarthak for his deep product expertise and ability to align, lead, and deliver, stakeholders and projects, and earnestly believe he will be a valued addition as both a product manager and great all-around teammate and friend.”",

I was immensely grateful to have him on our team, as Sarthak is a consistent high-performer and able to embrace more complex projects with confidence (especially those that didn't have a clear path forward at the start.) He is great at diagnosing the right problem and has a persistent focus on finding answers/creating actionable guidance most meaningful for clients. ”"
