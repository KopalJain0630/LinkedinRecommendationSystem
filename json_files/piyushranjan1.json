        "Ramal Jagan “I liked the way the Piyush and his team team helped me in identifying my strengths and weaknesses as well as aiding me in crafting my story which could highlight the right strengths to the admission committees of the schools that I applied to. The workshops conducted in the early stages of my interaction with the Management Masters Team gave me great insights into how to do retrospect and craft a beautiful SOP and Resume. The best thing about working with Management Masters was the speed with which I received feedback while going through the process of drafting my SOPs. On many occasions, I did not even have to wait for 24 hours to get feedback. The interview preparation was also wonderful and the Team prepped me with all sorts of possible questions that I would face, boosting my confidence a lot. ”",
        "Milind Swaroop “The best thing was to genuinely contextualize the whole process in the real story of the applicant. It inspires a lot of self-confidence in the applicant and the process becomes a lot more easier. I also received great guidance on how to polish and display your life story in the applications.”"
