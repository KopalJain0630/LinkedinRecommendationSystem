Yash helps me as the Chief of Staff for Growth Advisory work and with InsightsAlley work earlier. Yash is a very good generalist operator. He is able to get almost all aspects of business and is able to do any type of specialist work as well. He does his work in a methodical way and is able to anticipate the needs of customer, asking questions proactively. He does not live, think or work in a predetermined or limited box but constantly looks at ways of redefining it and removing such limitations.
