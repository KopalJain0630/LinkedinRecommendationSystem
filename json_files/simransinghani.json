Resilience, bias for action and initiative is what best describes what she brings to a team. She is keen on learning something new, and fast. She's eager to contribute especially when you need someone to bank on at a critical moment. Her curiosity always keeps her Manager on their toes but she's the first to assist incase anything needs support (including humour in small doses!). She isn't afraid of calling things out that need improvement/taking ownership to fix them and that's why she'd be a tremendous asset to a team that wants to build both right + fast.‚Äù"
