        "Rahul Dsouza “Have had the immense pleasure of working with Harsh on Growth Strategy, Manufacturing Excellence and People Cost Optimization Piece for an Automotive Client. Earlier, used to perceive freshers as folks who would need a lot of hand holding till they find their feet and true potential. And boy, was I wrong when I met Harsh. changed my perspective on how Freshers can hit the ground running from Day Zero itself. Harsh is as enthusiastic a person can get, a true go-getter, is able to structure a problem statement very appropriately which makes him an analytical problem solver. I cannot count the no. of times, he has gone above and beyond and stretched himself to deliver Client ready stuff by burning the midnight oil. His versatility is also commendable. He is great in Excel, PowerPoint abilities, Problem Statement articulation, Presentation skills, Storyboarding. He manages complete workstreams on his own, taking full ownership and accountability. He also possesses skillsets in R, Power BI. All of the above has made him a true Talent Priority for the firm. Another quality which has come to him, quite quickly I might add, is Client Stakeholder Management. The client has always spoken on the value Harsh brings to the table for them and the dependency they have on him, which showcases his credibility. While Professionally, he is well on his way to reach greater heights, personally, he is a great human-being looking out for folks especially his juniors, who he has trained on various skillsets so that he can create similar gems like himself. I wish Harsh all the best for his future endeavours.”"
