He was also really good at pushing our team to achieve our goals. Really enjoyed working together and would have Max on my team in a heartbeat!”",

This is great - no time wasted. Moreover, he shows excellent leadership and is concerned about the mental health of his co-workers but at the same time, he knows to motivate and push people to bring out their full potential. Also, he is my personal HubSpot wizard. He is now in a management position but Max is also the best hands-on operations guy I know. It is a pleasure to work with him.”"
