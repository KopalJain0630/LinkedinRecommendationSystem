The result indicates that it produces same output as that of hierarchical clustering without any deviations. Thus it eliminates the disadvantage of both the approaches while incorporating their advantages.\"},{\"title\":\"Purchasing Trend of Soft Drinks in VIT, Asian Journal of Research in Social Sciences & Humanities, ISSN 2249 – 7315, Vol 4, No. 2, February 2014, pp. 300 – 314.\",\"start_date\":\"Jan 2013\",\"end_date\":\"Apr 2013\",\"description\":\"It is a vivid research project on the Purchasing Trends of Soft drink of the students within my college.

The protocol modifies the IEEE 80211 backoff algorithm, which is used to control the contention window in the case of collisions, in order to provide a better QoS performance according to the network status and condition. The new algorithms have been tested against the legacy IEEE 802.11 through simulations using NS2. The tests have shown significant improvements in performance, improvement in delay and improvement in packet delivery fraction compared to the original IEEE.\"},{},{\"title\":\"Android Application for College Attendance System\",\"start_date\":\"May 2012\",\"end_date\":\"Jun 2012\",\"description\":\"An android application was made for the online attendance portal in which student can view their attendance for all the registered courses while faculties have the option to post the attendance and also pass any message to the batch through SMS service\"},{}]",
