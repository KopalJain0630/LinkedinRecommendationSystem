        "Michael Leyba “Wilson was a pleasure to work with in investment banking. What I appreciated about working with Wilson was his strong work ethic, his high level of focus, his ability to learn new skills quickly, and his reliability on projects. I knew that I could always count on him when we had difficult project work under tight deadlines. I worked in investment banking for 10 years and during my time, there were a handful of analysts that stood out and separated themselves through their work ethic, grit and analytical ability, Wilson was one of those few.”",
