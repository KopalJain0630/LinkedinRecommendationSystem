He would inform us of the various technical and fundamental aspects of the VC landscape. Zoeb coordinated with the Founders of the portfolio companies with intelligence, calm and confidence. Also, he was more than eager to push us to work with the fellow companies’ Founders to be able to help solve their problems and provide us with a hands-on experience of working with entrepreneurs. If fate may allow, I would love to work with this consummate professional at any firm, let alone at Sauce Venture Capital.”",
