        "Dmitry Fedoseyev “I am pleased to recommend Pawan as an exceptional iOS Swift engineer. In our time working together, Pawan has consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of iOS development, particularly with low-level APIs. His expertise in handling complex tasks such as sending image buffers between app and app extension and audio routing has been invaluable. Pawan's proficiency in SwiftUI is impressive, allowing him to create intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. He often provides insightful feedback to our design team, enhancing the overall user experience with thoughtful and constructive suggestions. His technical skills, combined with a collaborative approach and a keen eye for design, make Pawan an outstanding asset to any development team. I highly recommend him for any iOS development role.”",
        "Tejus Adiga M “Pawan is very passionate about what he does. He is a self-starter and he often thinks on the lines of how the feature should be rather than how to make it work. He is very creative and can communicate his thoughts clearly. Pawan is a critical thinker and not afraid to question assumptions. In working with him I have seen him getting involved in each and everything and making great contributions.”"

For this, a point light source of illumination, perspective projection and six-degree motion of the endoscope are considered. Previous approaches attempted to recover polyp shape with the help of extended Kalman filter (EKF) and monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from a static scene. Our approach uses iterative data acquisition approach with the existing EKF Monocular SLAM and the intensity model prior. Our method constructs a dense 3D model of polyp by utilizing sparse data, which are collected by a Monocular EKF SLAM and a base model prior. Experimental results show the efficacy of our proposed method.\"}]",
