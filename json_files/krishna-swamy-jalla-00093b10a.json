        "Nick N. “I worked with Krishna in the Marketing Analytics group at Cigna. During this time, Krishna was very enthusiastic about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing. This was often demonstrated by the way he could cut across our department and pull in team members as needed to help solve important business problems. Krishna was very helpful when it came to our transition to Cloud/ML -- he has a gift when it comes to thinking critically about how to use technology to solve a business problem and what the key assumptions around the problem are. As a result, Krishna was instrumental when it came to optimizing our Data Science products for distribution and consumption across the enterprise. For these reasons, I would recommend Krishna for any Data Science Manager role. ”"
