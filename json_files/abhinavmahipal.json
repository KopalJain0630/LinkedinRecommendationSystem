        "Pushkar Singh “I have the good fortune of working with Abinav for almost a year now. Abhinav was the first person to join our investments business at Tremis. It's common to find smart people in India who are great at number crunching and analysis. But Abhinav brings something extra to the table. His interpersonal skills are exemplary. I have to say I haven't met many people who are so good at both finance and relationships. Many early stage founders have told me that they relish working with Abhinav. They adore his professional and friendly approach. He's always accomodating to founders needs and helps them in every way possible. His nonchalant manners puts everyone at ease. We totally trust his judgement for our investments. If he says no to a startup, we know he has solid reasons behind it. He always does his homework, and I've seen him become excellent at his job. His exhaustive market knowledge about the Indian startups gives him a massive edge in picking out the best opportunities from hundreds of leads we get every month. I wish him all the best in his career, and I hope Tremis will continue to benefit from his skills and knowledge.”"
