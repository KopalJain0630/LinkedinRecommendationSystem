Thus like authenticated users, hackers or intruder arealso able to crack security system. So, researchers, scientist are moving to newdirections as well as merging of different types of algorithms. Different GPSenabled devices like smart phone, PDA are easily accessible which alsosupports many different application that extracts patterns like iris, finger printetc. Biometric features can be used along with location of intended receiver todevelop cryptographic algorithm. Different smart phone apps provide bothlocation and can extract the biometric features by which people can form newkey. The focus of this paper is to examine that merging of two approaches isadvantageous as it provides more security to data.\"},{\"title\":\"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms on Diabetic Retinopathy\",\"subtitle\":\"IEEE\",\"date\":\"May 19, 2017\",\"description\":\"Diabatic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading cause of sight inefficiency for diabetic patients. The clinical diagnostic results and several outcome of eye testing methods reviled a set of observations that eases the decision making in the case of diabetic retinopathy for the doctor, therapist. Machinelearning, a branch of artificial intelligence is applied in clinical data analytic as it can detect patterns in data, and then use these uncovered patterns to predict future data or perform some kind of decision making under uncertainty. In case of DR finding the co-relation between the depth of affection and the clinical result is very much critical, as several parameters are need to be taken into consideration for optimal decision making by the therapist. In this paper we have reviewed the performance of aset of machine learning algorithms and verify their performance for a particular DR data set.\"}]",
