As an early subscriber, I am fortunate to see firsthand how doodhwala has been growing a strong, not just readership, but may I say a 'cult' through their witty milkman communication and in-depth analysis of web3. One can never underestimate the grind of writing a daily newsletter while maintaining humor and creativity consistently in all their work. I have also met Aakash at various web3 events in Bangalore, and have noticed his efforts to have a finger on the pulse of the industry. I expect some cutting-edge work in media to come out of what they are building at doodhwala and wish him the best.‚Äù",
