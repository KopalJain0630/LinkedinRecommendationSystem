As his immediate senior in our same alma mater IIEST, Shibpur, I was very happy with his contribution towards his department to start the first edition of the Technical Fest of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics Stream. He played a pivotal role along with his departmental seniors, batchmates and juniors and has set up a foundation stone for the coming years. It's a huge platform for this stream and since it was the first time such an event was being organised, a job I would say very well done. All of us seniors were proud of the junior years to make such an effective change. Keep doing the good work. ”",
        "Namit Bhasin “Sudhansu is a passionate and enterprising individual capable of handling multiple responsibilities at the same time. I interacted with Sudhansu during his work for TEDx IIEST Shibpur, what impressed me the most was his ability to clearly communicate and engage with multiple stakeholders. I am sure he will be an asset to any organization he will be a part of. I wish him the best for his future endeavors. ”"
