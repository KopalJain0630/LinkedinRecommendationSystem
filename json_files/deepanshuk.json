        "Nishant Chawla “When I was in Microsoft, everyone pointed me to Deepanshu as the go-to person for all answers to questions about the data. Deepanshu and I worked together on foundational projects of Microsoft Edge Browser, and can't speak more highly about Deepanshu. Deepanshu has a deep wealth of knowledge both in technical skills as well as the business domain. He is an excellent communicator and is very passionate about the projects he takes on. Deepanshu does not cut corners but rather thinks two steps ahead and tries to solve for tomorrow's problems. Any team with Deepanshu as a member is already set up for success. I look forward to someday collaborating with Deepanshu again!”",
        "Pulkit Garg “I have worked with Deepanshu long time back at Thorogood in my first job. We were all direct from college hires and Deepanshu was the only lateral hire who joined couple of months later. He has immaculate understanding of the business ask and the necessary coding skills required to problem solve it. Other than his strong tech background, he’s also a good person who’ll proactively ask if any help required or if you are stuck in a challenging coding problem. His ability to follow up and follow through will make him a great leader in the coming years.”"
