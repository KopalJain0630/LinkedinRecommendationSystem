    "about": "Early in my career, I was described as a fighter. I believe the two most important elements of success are “right attitude” and “discipline”. Having accumulated experience in banking, and asset management, I wear my fighter badge with a lot of pride. I am ready to roll up my sleeves and get my hands dirty and do whatever it takes to get the job done. Things that define me are perception, my desire to work hard, ability to adapt and learn in a new environment. I strongly believe \"The only way to do great work is to love what we do.\"",

These are the two defining features of Souvik, because no matter what the work, he will always find a positive side to it and look to learn from his experience. Souvik and I worked together only for ~10 months, but it feels like I've known him for 10 years! He has the uncanny ability to befriend anyone, and is fearless, proactive and yet humble, which is a potent combination for the world we live in. After joining a role that was completely alien to him, he picked up a multitude of diverse skills in such a short time that it was a treat to watch. Souvik works hard, takes full responsibility for his efforts and gets totally involved in everything he does. All this makes him not just an ideal colleague but also an exceptional friend.”"
