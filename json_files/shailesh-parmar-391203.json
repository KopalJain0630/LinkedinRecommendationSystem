He is extremely results focused, and is able to produce under very adverse conditions. In one instance, I worked with Shailesh to help him develop an application for the desk he was supporting. Shailesh was totally unfamiliar with the application framework, but was able to produce a high quality app for the desk with minimal guidance from me.”",
