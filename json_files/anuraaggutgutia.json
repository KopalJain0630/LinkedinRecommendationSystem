        "Anupama Anand ‚ÄúAnuraag is very hard working and has a great attitude. He spent 3 months with us at DB in the Global Credit team during which he delivered high quality work. He is very motivated and a keen learner and I was particularly impressed with how quickly he picked up financial statements analysis. He also worked long hours and weekends and did this with great vigour. I wish him all the very best in all his future endeavours! Look forward to hearing great things about him!‚Äù",
        "Marian Micu ‚ÄúI am coordinating Anuraag‚Äôs work on currency research for more than a year now. Anuraag has three main qualities: integrity, intelligence and energy. He is a very thoughtful researcher, very creative and committed to deliver top quality work. He also has excellent leadership skills, being always ready to help and genuinely interested in the success of the team. Although one of the youngest members in my team, he was nominated as the lead researcher and successfully represented the team in the asset class committees. He also took the initiative of developing a global risk model for currencies, which significantly improved our risk management process. His qualities recommend him as one of the most promising researchers I worked with in terms of research quality, team-building and leadership‚Äù"
