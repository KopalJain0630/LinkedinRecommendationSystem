Curiosity, openness to candid conversations, an authentic interest in the topics she covers, and an unquenchable hunger for self-development—are just a few of the key ingredients Aarushi has that empower her to make great content. You can’t buy these qualities. Either a writer has these things or they don’t. I’ve been working with Aarushi on the VEED blog for about a year now and I only wish I’d met her sooner. Any company looking to take their content from good to addictingly great needs Aarushi on their team.”",
        "Brittany Wren “Aarushi is an incredibly empathetic and knowledgeable writer. She is able to jump in and tackle long, complex, technical topics with fluency. While doing so, she manages to use a tone, cadence, and vocabulary that appeals to a technical audience without being boring (that's such a tough line to walk!). Aarushi is also one of those rare writer gems that not only takes feedback graciously...she solicits and welcomes it.”"
