        "Suryansh Rajput ‚ÄúAfter taking multiple attempts on the GMAT and taking coaching from several institutions, I finally decided to join Parveen sir. His way of teaching DI and Verbal helped me to cross 90 percentile on the real GMAT Focus exam fairly easily. Not only did I cross 90 percentile on the GMAT Focus exam but I also realised that DI and Verbal have become my favourite sections (which I dreaded the most). Every passing class made me more knowledgeable and instilled confidence in me. Like me, if you are planning to cross the 90 percentile mark on GMAT Focus, I will highly recommend Parveen sir.‚Äù",
        "Prerna Advani ‚ÄúThanks to Parveen sir, I finally scored a 725 (99 percentile) on the GMAT Focus. This was my 5th attempt on the GMAT. My previous scores were 580, 610, 535, and 575. After my fourth attempt and after wasting more than a year I finally decided to take help from a private GMAT tutor. I took his classes for all the 3 subjects (Q, DI, and V). My biggest challenge was DI and Verbal. In fact in DI I used to take more than an hour to solve 10 DI questions and used to get more than half of them wrong. In Verbal I was weak in both CR and RC, particularly CR troubled a lot. His class notes and teaching style in Verbal and DI, made every question I attempted in Verbal and DI look so easy. The initial panic I had, particularly in DI, just vanished. In Quant I relied on his topic-wise class notes and the Official Guides only. My breakup Q 86 (92 Percentile): I got 2 wrongs V 87 (99 Percentile). I got 4 wrongs: 2 CR and 2 RC DI 85 (99 Percentile). I got 4 wrongs: 1 DS, 1 MSR, and 2 TPA‚Äù"
