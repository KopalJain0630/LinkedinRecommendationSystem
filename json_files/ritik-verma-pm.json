        "Tushar Nath “I mentored Ritik during his product management internship at MYM. He's quick to understand new concepts and good at turning ideas into plans. Ritik has a solid grasp of user needs and how they fit with business goals. He communicates well with different teams and is always eager to learn. What stood out was how he took feedback on board and used it to improve his work. For a newcomer to product management, Ritik showed promise. He's hardworking and works well in a team. I think he'd be a good addition to any product team looking for fresh talent.”",
