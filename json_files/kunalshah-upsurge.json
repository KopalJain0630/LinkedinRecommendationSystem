Coming from a corporate, I was used to following an SOP for each task, but Kunal preferred we think out-of-the-box and bring creativity in every little task we performed. He created a safe space for us where we could be open about our challenges and problems. I learnt from him a great deal of how to lead discussions with industry experts, further my knowledge in finance and make sure I was able to take charge of work when he was not around. ”",

His ability to multi-task and manage so many things simultaneously with a calm mindset still awes me. It seems like Getting shit done comes to him naturally:) In the duration of a 3-month internship as a project manager at Valuationary, I've understood one thing that any intern would be lucky to work & learn with him.”"
