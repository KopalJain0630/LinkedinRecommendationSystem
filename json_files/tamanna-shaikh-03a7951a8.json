Her professionalism and diligent attitude are the key reasons behind her success. Without a doubt, she is an absolute asset to the organization and a great colleague to work with!”",
        "LinkedIn User “My interaction with Tamanna began during the interview process at Sobha, where I was selected for a position. Initially, my joining date was set for one month in the future. However, unforeseen circumstances at my current workplace forced me to extend my joining date to three months.Tamanna took the initiative and ensured I received a three-month extension, showcasing her dedication to candidates.Subsequently, an unexpected health emergency necessitated an extended leave to India.With this prolonged break, I was concerned about losing the opportunity to join Sobha. However, I remembered Tamanna's words when she initially assured me, \"Let me know when you are back, and we will see.\" After five months, I reached out to her, expressing my need for employment and inquiring about the availability of the position. Tamanna exhibited incredible dedication by approaching her manager to consider my candidacy, despite the prolonged absence, ultimately leading to my acceptance at Sobha.Tamanna's remarkable qualities as an HR professional are undeniable. In an industry where many companies would not wait for a candidate for such an extended period, Tamanna demonstrated a level of dedication that is truly commendable. not only appreciate the opportunity to join Sobha, but I also believe that Tamanna Shaikh is a shining example of what an exceptional HR professional should be. Her dedication to candidates, coupled with her ability to understand and empathize with their individual circumstances, is a true asset to any organization.”"
