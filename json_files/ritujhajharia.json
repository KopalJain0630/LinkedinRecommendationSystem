Very few people have the level of clarity about their goals (Life and Professional) as Ritu has and she conciously contributes towards those goals everyday. Ritu is a complete subject matter expert on Digital Marketing and Martech tools. During the period we worked together, she has consistently demonstrated her intelligence, diligence, and action-oriented approach. She is strong on integrity and basic human values. Moreover, she is not only a valuable colleague but also a great friend who is always ready to support and collaborate. Ritu's dedication and skills make her an invaluable asset to any organization lucky enough to have her on their team.” Show less",
        "“My association with Ritu goes back to our MBA days in MICA and there was always an unwavering spark in her that told me that she is cut out from the normal crowd. She had confidence and conviction for creative ideas and all-round versatile personality. I could see her professional side as Head of Content at LEAD. LEAD, the first ed-tech unicorn of 2022, Ritu could be seen streamlining the multitude of tasks at her disposal seamlessly. She could brainstorm the next social media campaign with my agency yet she could plan out another brand campaign on another medium in the same breath! I was amazed to see her undying energy and the amount of effort she undertook for everyone around. I think she is a wonderful asset to any organization and if you have her in your team, rest assured, you are in for a superlative performance!” Show less"
