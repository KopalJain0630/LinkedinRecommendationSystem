        "Abhishek Gupta “I've had a pleasure knowing Samuel for 2 months during which he worked as a Business Development Intern. Above all, I was impressed with his ability to provide out of the box ideas and solutions. He always took the initiative whenever a challenging situation arose and was able to deliver his best. He would be a true asset for any organization and I wish him all the best for his professional endeavors.”"
