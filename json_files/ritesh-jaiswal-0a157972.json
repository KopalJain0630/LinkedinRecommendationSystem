In the time that we worked together at Goodera, I have witnessed him toil hard to not only efficiently turnaround his deliverables well within time but also utilize the remaining time to drastically improve his presentation skills. As a colleague and a friend, Ritesh is extremely caring and resourceful and would often go out of his way to assist me and others in the office with their daily tasks. Ritesh perseveres in the face of the toughest of challenges and is constantly in pursuit of opportunities for self-improvement. Working with an ambitious, hardworking and kind-hearted colleague like Ritesh has been truly inspirational and I am sure he will continue to do that in whichever team he works with.‚Äù Show less"
