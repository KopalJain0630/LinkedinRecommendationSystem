Due to increasing environmental, economic and regulatory issues there is an urgent need to implement GSCM but Indian tube manufacturing SMEs are struggling to do it. This paper aims to identify various critical success factors to implement GSCM in Indian tube manufacturing SMEs by consultation with the industry experts and academicians. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique is adopted to propose a structural model that not only helps us to understand the interrelationships between the different CSFs but also explains their interdependence in implementing GSCM. MICMAC analysis is performed to determine the driving and dependence power of the CSFs and classify them according to their significance. This approach is applied to 10 tube-manufacturing industries in the western region of India.About Book:This book focuses on novel design and systems engineering approaches, including theories and best practices, for promoting a better integration of people and engineering systems. It covers a range of hot topics related to: development of human-centered systems; interface design and human-computer interaction; usability and user experience; emergent properties of human behavior; innovative materials in manufacturing, bio-mechanics, and sports medicine, safety engineering and systems complexity business analytics, design and technology and many more.\"}]",
