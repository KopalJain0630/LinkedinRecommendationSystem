        "Siddharth Agarwal “Pooja always comes across as an extremely confident and genuine person, anyone who has had the opportunity to interact with her will be of the same opinion. As the captain of the team, she handled the responsibility beautifully, voluntarily took charge of all administrative work and didn't hesitate in taking the backseat whenever required for the team to progress. Pooja is an asset to whatever team she's a part of and has the ability to inspire as a leader.”",
        "Vishesh Gupta “If there were two words to describe Pooja, they'd be resourceful and positive. In this case, if she hadn't been in touch with Hansa Ma'am of Disha Seema Care Center, this project would have had nothing to begin with. Her optimism has always been a strong support for the entire team, even when her own workload was overwhelming. When Pooja gets at it, things get going.”"
