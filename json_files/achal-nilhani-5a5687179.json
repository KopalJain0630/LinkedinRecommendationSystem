Our main contribution to this ongoing research into the audio-based detection of COVID-19 disease is that we have developed a classification mechanism which yields satisfactory results and is of sufficiently low complexity to be suitable for implementation in low-resource devices.\"},{\"title\":\"A novel sound source localization method using a global-best guided cuckoo search algorithm for drone-based search and rescue operations\",\"subtitle\":\"Unmanned Aerial Systems: Theoretical Foundation and Applications\",\"date\":\"January 29, 2021\",\"description\":\"During disaster management, unmanned aerial vehicles play an important role as they are deployed for effective search and rescue operations. Nowadays, personnel from many emergency services like police officers, firefighters, and volunteers in rescue teams take advantage of drones for cost-effective and time-efficient search and rescue operations. All drone-based search operations to date either have used vision-based drones or require direct human assistance along with the drone. During low or almost no visible light conditions, as well as in foggy weather, it becomes nearly impossible for vision-based drones to continue the search operation. Thus, we propose an alternative approach for drone-based search and rescue operations using acoustic source localization. During the search operation, the sound source is the victim, who is screaming for help. The signal emitted by the source will be recorded using an array of microphones embedded in the drone structure. Thus a novel approach is presented to analyze the captured audio signals for accurate source localization. The proposed method deals with the ego noise and wind noise generated by the motion of drone, its motors, propellers, and other stationary structural noise. A global-best guided cuckoo search optimization algorithm is used to estimate the noise components present in an unknown noisy signal. After estimation of noise either temporal subtraction is used in proposed Algorithm 1 or the Wiener filter as in proposed Algorithm 2 to suppress the noise. Afterward, the time difference of arrival-based sound source localization (SSL) is carried out to compute the coordinates of the speech source. The results demonstrated that Algorithms 1 and 2 both can localize the sound sources effectively whereas conventional SSL algorithms failed to produce the correct results. Further, Algorithm 2 outperforms Algorithm 1 in terms of accurate position estimation and signal-to-noise ratio improvement.\"}]",

We recently organized a DNS challenge special session at INTERSPEECH 2020 and ICASSP 2020. We open-sourced training and test datasets for the wideband scenario. We also open-sourced a subjective evaluation framework based on ITU-T standard P.808, which was used to evaluate challenge submissions. Many researchers from academia and industry made significant contributions to push the field forward, yet even the best noise suppressor was far from achieving superior speech quality in challenging scenarios. In this version of the challenge organized at INTERSPEECH 2021, we are expanding both our training and test datasets to accommodate full band scenarios. The two tracks in this challenge will focus on real-time denoising for (i) wide band, and (ii) full band scenarios. We are also making available a reliable non-intrusive objective speech quality metric for wide band called DNSMOS for the participants to use during their development phase.\"},{\"title\":\"DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-COST VENTILATORS FOR PATIENTS DURING COVID-19PANDEMIC\",\"start_date\":\"Apr 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Jun 2020\",\"description\":\"* Selected as Winner Project by UC Berkeley (CEND) and received grant USD 1,000 forventilator prototype development.* Technical Head in a team of 6 membersDesigned a low-cost, easily deployable ventilator system with featuresincluding air pressure, flow, tidal volume, Positive End Expiratory Pressure(PEEP), Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FIO2) control.\"},{\"title\":\"DRONE: FOR EFFECTIVE SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION USINGSOUND SOURCE LOCALIZATION\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Feb 2020\",\"description\":\"* A novel optimization based algorithm to eliminate ego noise and wind noisefrom drone embedded microphone array data for accurate sound (speech)localization using angular spectrum methods.* Developed a market-ready prototype with proposed algorithm implemented init.
