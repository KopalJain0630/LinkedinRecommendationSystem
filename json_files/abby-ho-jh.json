        "Desmond Teo “I had the pleasure of working closely with Abby during my internship at M Venture Partners (MVP). Abby stands out through both her commitment and excellent stakeholder management. She is highly ambitious and is proactive in taking initiatives for both MVP’s portfolio companies and the companies she believes in. She is a goal-getter who sets high yet achievable milestones for herself and accomplishes them along the way. Finally, Abby is also a great mentor. Her guidance, openness, and patience have allowed me to learn and grow immensely while working together.”"
