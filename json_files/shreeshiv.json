His versatile performance on numerous fronts has been owing to his conceptual clarity and strong grasp of subjects which made him technically proficient. I remember when Shreeshiv approached me for his startup idea discussion. Despite having an internship offer from a fintech company, he chose to work on his own venture. He had a plan to build a cloud based platform for organizing and storing all invoices at one location. I wish him the best of luck for his future endeavors”"
