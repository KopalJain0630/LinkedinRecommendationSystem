        "LinkedIn User “Jyotika not only achieved strong results but was also a strong role model to follow as a manager. She constantly supported her subordinates and stood up for them, and I saw firsthand that she was willing to put her people and her clients first. In my opinion this is a very undervalued leadership trait, but one that critically builds trust. Jyotika achieved superb results as well, and made sure that her subordinates understood the basics behind how she achieved these results, through hard work and having an eye for detail. Whenever we needed help, she was extremely responsive and her experience in the business world was evident in the way she brought her strategic thinking and acumen to the table. I would be happy to recommend Jyotika as I was proud to have worked on her team. ”"
