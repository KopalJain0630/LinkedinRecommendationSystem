Having interacted with her for past 6-7 months for the IIT KGP Alumni meet, where she and her team must have called at least 2000 alumni (multiple times) to get in touch. Then ensuring that they are able to make, and once they start their journey from home, to the day they head back to home.. no stone are left unturned. The arrangements for room, transportation, food, photography, events etc nothing was left unplanned. The whole program was such well orchestrated that best of event management companies can learn from them I went to institute after 25 years, she and her team ensured I feel homely, safe.
