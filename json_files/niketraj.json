He loves disruptive innovation and that helps him ride new age digital business opportunity, all the while, keeping one leg firmly planted in the offline world. He leads a team of responsive, bright and honest professionals at his company - The Write Order. His values of integrity and transparency reflect in his team members. From embarking on acquisitions to continually exploring revenue opportunities in the IPR space, he is growing the valuation of his company every day. Keep up the energy and hunger Niket. You have many more mountains to climb and many more flags to hoist. I have no doubt you will emerge victorious through your own differentiated path!
