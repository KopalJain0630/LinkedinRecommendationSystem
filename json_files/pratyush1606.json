I found Pratyush to be very interested and curious in working with and learning new things. He used to actively participate in all the team activities so much so that he used to be the first one to complete them. He is great to work with in a team. He was always very helpful and approachable. He used to offer his time and help wherever he could. I found him to be a detail oriented individual as well. He figured out a minute bug in our website that was as a result, displaying wrong info and fixed it. Ever ready to collaborate with him again :)”"
