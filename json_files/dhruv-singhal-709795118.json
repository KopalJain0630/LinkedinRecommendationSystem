        "LinkedIn User “I worked with Dhruv on Knowledge Graph-based recommendation system. This project had an extremely steep learning curve and yet Dhruv was not only able to grasp the concepts but also actively developed key machine learning & deep learning components within that project. He is very particular about delivery and usually over-delivers. Beyond his technical prowess, his communication skills are also very sharp. He can articulate his thoughts very clearly and concisely. Plus he has a knack for leading conversations. This enables him to remove ambiguity that might arise during planning/discussions. Which had a visible impact on the team's productivity. He proved to be an excellent addition to the team and I highly recommend him.”",
        "Rajesh Hegde “We had Dhruv as an Intern at Dblue, though it was for a shorter period, he could get a lot of things done and pick up the engineering aspects very fast. He is very hard-working and never sleeps before finishing the work. Dhruv would be a best fit for any team and gels with everyone.”"
