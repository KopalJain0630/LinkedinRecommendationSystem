Our hypothesis is that the village- and neighborhood-level prevalence of child undernutrition indicators, anemia in children and women of reproductive age, child and maternal mortality, and childhood illness episodes (diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections) can be accurately estimated from satellite imagery and other geotagged data. We further hypothesize that we can estimate these indicators accurately for a specific point in time as well as track changes over time.\"},{},{},{\"title\":\"AI and ML Potency in Marketing Landscape: A case study\",\"start_date\":\"May 2023\",\"end_date\":\"Jul 2023\",\"description\":\"The goal of this project is to improve and analyze marketing outcomes and key performance indicators through the use of AI and ML mediation.
