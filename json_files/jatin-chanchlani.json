I was a bit skeptical in the beginning that how he would cope up with Investment Banking since he had no previous knowledge of finance. But, I must say he had worked very quickly on his finance skills. He is very obedient, a quick learner, a good team player and has a good work ethic. I have no doubt that Jatin will continue to excel in his career and make a significant impact in any organization they choose to be a part of. I wholeheartedly recommend Jatin and am confident that they have a bright future ahead.”"
