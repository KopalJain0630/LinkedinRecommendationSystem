        "Deepak Bunde ‚ÄúI learnt much more about e-commerce in the two months of internship under Mr.Ranjit than I did with a full course at my B-school. It was a tough, yet rewarding experience being under his guidance for the pre-launch study of a B2C e-commerce portal. The methodic way in which he would listen to and dissect the proposed plans made by his mentees made them efficient and much better business analysts by the end of the projects. He has an impeccable business acumen and is a natural leader, no wonder he brought one of the hottest e-startups the market has seen in the past few years. I wish all the success for btp!‚Äù"
