His corporate world experience combined with his entrepreneurship and life lessons makes Binod a very practical Exec Coach. Binod is a straight shooter with no fluff, and you will get honest advise. He is making a significant impact to CEO's and is highly recommended.”",
        "Mohammed Nihal Nazar, ACCA, CFA “I had the privilege of learning from Binod and now, as a keynote speaker and executive coach, he continues to inspire me in new and profound ways. Binod is a no-nonsense, straightforward individual who embodies brutal honesty, an exceptionally rare quality in today’s world of Yes-men. His ability to deliver unfiltered truth as a speaker is something I deeply admire. Binod has an unparalleled attention to detail, ensuring that whatever he has to deliver is fully understood. As a coach and speaker, he goes beyond professional development, encouraging his audience to engage in deep self-reflection. His teachings are not just about achieving career success, but about becoming an honest, morally grounded individual, a perspective that has had a lasting impact on me. I have been fortunate to experience Binod's wisdom in both personal and professional growth settings and I can confidently say that his influence has played a crucial role in shaping my journey as a young adult and professional. His recent book, \"Let's Get Real,\" based on his personal experiences, is next on my reading list and I am eager to learn even more from him. Binod's authenticity and commitment to helping others grow make him not just a remarkable coach, but a truly transformative speaker. I wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone seeking honest, impactful guidance.”"
