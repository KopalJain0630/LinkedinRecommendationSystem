        "Nilanjan S. “I had the privilege of working along with Debojyoti on multiple projects and had known him beyond work. He's a self motivated professional with a hunger to learn things that can be converted into business proposals easily. I enjoyed my time learning from him a plethora of things. Talking to him would freshen up ideas on the latest market, business trends, tech, strategy, action plants and anything and everything that's gray ! Debo is also a very data driven person but his deep down analysis, spectrum of opinions and his fearless out of the box ideas are something that I admire the most. You can walk to him with an empty head he can guide on any subject on this planet. A fast learner and what an awesome team player he is !”",
        "Rishi Taneja “Exceptional worker and a hands on team player. Debojyoti had an extremely positive attitude towards work and inspired everyone around him due to his excellent multi tasking abilities. He earns my highest recommendation not just as an impactful employee but as a genuine and a kind human as well.”"
