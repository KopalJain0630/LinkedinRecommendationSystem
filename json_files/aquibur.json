        "Pavan Bapesh Vinnakota “My first impression of Aquib was that of a calm and thoughtful person who looks at a problem from multiple perspectives before implementing his approach. This is fundamentally different from the kind of boilerplate or knee-jerk strategies which are all too common when it comes to marketing. I have worked with Aquib for over a year at Cleartax during which period he was pivotal in re-imagining the entire spectrum of marketing activities. His impact was many-fold, starting with an overhaul of search & display campaigns, maintaining consistency in user messaging and a vigorous focus on organic channels. Under his guidance, we created seamless campaigns across disparate channels, depending on product-journey and user touch-points. This kind of user centric approach worked wonders in improving funnel completion and retention rates, and significantly lowered acquisition costs. He has a data-driven approach towards decision making and is consistently looking to experiment with newer and better platforms while always avoiding unnecessary spends (which is perfect for an agile startup). As a manager, Aquib is always receptive and created opportunities for us to grow and learn. He always encourages new ideas and gives room to experiment. He is the kind of person who isn't shy of getting into the nuts and bolts of a problem, and has a knack of getting right to the bottom of an issue. If you're looking for any help with marketing or allied operations, you are in good hands here!”",
        "Ankur Arora “I Have worked with aqib at Cleartax for about 2 years. He was instrumental in setting up the entire marketing function within 4 months and headed both B2c and b2b marketing , lead and motivated the team who were a bunch of young enthusiastic folks. Under his leadership Cleartax built a strong digital brand in GST and became the number 1 cloud player in the country. He is a great team player, solid thinker with strong execution abilities. Any startup would love to have him to head its marketing function.”"
