As CEO at that time he managed to bring the company profitable and has also boost up the business volume.

I have seen him turn round a company and put it on solid rails while being a most likeable chief executive. He has excellent and easy human touch without detracting from his self-effaced and unassuming character. This is Saleem's forte: in a service industry, he has business acuteness coupled with HR capabilities. These attributes would make no sense were it not for complimentary qualities of honesty, integrity and trustworthiness.‚Äù Show less"
