A newly identified iron regulator, hepcidin reveals the body's iron status and demand for erythropoiesis to the intestine which modulates intestinal iron absorption. Hepcidin plays a significant role in the iron regulatory system as it naturally binds to ferroportin which is the cellular iron expoter. The hepcidin was docked with bioactive compounds in catechin, chlorogenic acid, T. aestivum grass and 2,4 dihydroxy benzaldehyde in P. betel leaves. The aim of the current study is to investigate the interaction of bioactive compounds with hepcidin through molecular docking. All three bioactive compounds revealed significant interaction with hepcidin. Catechin showed highest binding energy (7.1 Kcal/mol) as compared to cholorogenic acid and 2,4 dihydroxy benzaldehyde.Page(s): 448-454ISSN: 0975-0959 (Online); 0301-1208 (Print)Appears in Collections:IJBB Vol.60(06) [June 2023]\"},{\"title\":\"An Understanding of Diabetes Mellitus Associated Complications, Treatment Modalities and Management Strategies.\",\"subtitle\":\"BIOSCIENCES BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH ASIA\",\"date\":\"Mar 2019\"},{\"title\":\"Phytochemical analysis and Antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract of Cissus quadrangularis L. against some pathogenic microorganisms.\",\"subtitle\":\"Indian Journal of Applied and Pure Biology\",\"date\":\"Jul 2018\"}]",
