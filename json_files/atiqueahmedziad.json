He reported directly to me as his manager and product owner. This was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Not only is Ziad a skilled and hard-working developer, but he is also an excellent communicator who proactively introduced order in the chaos of a start-up company. His efforts improved team health and ensured that all projects we worked on together were successfully completed within their deadlines. When new junior employees joined the team, he took it upon himself to mentor them. Ziad will be a wonderful addition to any team!”",
