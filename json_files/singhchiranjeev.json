His emphasis on building skills and guidance with GMAT helped me score a 90+ %ile. Definitely helps you see where you are going wrong and prepare with the right fundamentals. ”",
        "Soumyadeep Pal “I was part of CJ's GMAT Retakers cohort and had the chance to interact with this brilliant person during the sessions. Previously, I was struggling to improve my score in the classic edition of GMAT even after attempting the exam a couple of times. I was lucky enough to sign up for this brilliant initiative by CJ, for which he didn't charge a single penny for the entire curriculum. What makes his teaching style special and unique is the amount of time he spends on each question and the depth of his approach to resolving students' doubts. His holistic method of answering any kind of question was helpful to me and played a crucial role in significantly raising my score. He patiently listens to even the silliest of doubts until the doubt is resolved to the core. Lastly, I would like to say that CJ isn't just any other regular GMAT tutor but more than just a GMAT tutor. I am highly grateful to him for his guidance and support.”"
