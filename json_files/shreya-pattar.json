        "“Enterprises of all sizes come to me for LinkedIn marketing expertise, but when I needed to entrust the growth of my brand here on LinkedIn to someone, Shreya was the obvious choice. She was pleasant to work with, her content work performed fabulously, and I learned a great deal in the course of our engagement. I only ended our arrangement because I couldn't handle any more clients. I know people who charge 10x what she does for lower quality of work, too. Chat with her, you'll see what I mean (I get nothing for this recommendation and she doesn't even know I'm sending it right now)” Show less",
        "“I worked with Shreya for almost two years as a writer, and it was an absolute pleasure - right from start to finish. She is amongst the most organized, forward-thinking, and creative people out there, and her credentials and reputation stand testament to that. While working with her, at no point did I ever feel like I was short of ideas, and if there was anything I wanted to discuss, she was always available. The projects she trusted me with were challenging enough for me to give my best, and yet they were easy enough that they could be completed on time. I'm sure amongst the thousands of recommendations she's received, mine is another feather in her overfilled cap. If you're looking for someone to set you up with the right content, no matter what that may be, I'd suggest Shreya's name in a heartbeat! I'm looking forward to seeing what she does, and I hope our paths cross one another soon again.” Show less"
