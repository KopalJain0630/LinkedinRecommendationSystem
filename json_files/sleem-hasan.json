        "“After writing my business plan and financial model I was introduced to Privity a company run by Sleem Hasan. My initial meeting with Sleem was more about me as a individual rather than my business idea. Sleem is someone who wants to know the person behind the idea before performing a due diligence on the opportunity itself. The reason why I mentioned the person behind the idea and then the opportunity is down to one fact and that is Sleem will back you 1000% and he will work day and night to open doors leading to investment and business engagements. Privity is a well established and connected organization in Dubai with a 20 year track record with connections leading to the very top which my company has benefitted from. Sleem is connected to a well established Oxford & Cambridge Alumni network which branches across the UAE and it has been an absolute privilege to meet this network where the individuals I have been talking to ends with PHD. Working with Sleem a person with a mathematical mind and tutored by legendary Professor Steven Hawkings makes me feel so privileged to have connected with Sleem who I can call my brother. My journey with Sleem does not end here as I will be using Privity for ongoing strategic advisory ! Thank you Sleem for turning my dream into a reality and helping me to disrupt the Datacentre market across the UAE.” Show less",
