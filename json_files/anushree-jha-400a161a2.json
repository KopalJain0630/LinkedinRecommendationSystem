At many occasions I was (still am) inspired by her. She has an outstanding knowledge in the area of Applied Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science and Machine Learning. She is always interested in supporting others,learning and acquiring new skills. Apart from some natural qualities like calmness, polite behavior, she possess an analytic mind that helps to reach the core of a problem and pick up the inherent cause and effect relation. In gross view, I respect Anushree a lot and would highly recommend her and I believe that she will surely get success in her career.”"
