The genus Boswellia has roughly 25 species and are native to India, Pakistan, North eastern coast of Africa and Middle east. The Boswellic acids contain fourimportant isomers like (1).3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-Boswellic acid (AKBA), (2) 11-keto-βBoswellic acid(KBA) (3) acetylated α and β Boswellic acids(ABA) and (4) α and β Boswellicacids(BA) which are closely related isomers and are difficult to separate . It was of interest toexplore which of these isomers have better anti-inflammatory and better anti-cancer activityby carrying out in-silico study of their binding to anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer targets.\"},{\"title\":\"ENHANCEMENT OF SOLUBILITY, BIOAVAILABILITY & EFFICACY OF BOSWELLIC ACIDS BY ACETYLATION, BETA CYCLODEXTRIN ENCAPSULATION & PREPARING DIETHYL AMINE SALT\",\"subtitle\":\"Pharmaceutical Resonance 2020 Vol. 2 - Issue 2\",\"date\":\"January 1, 2020\",\"description\":\"The Boswellic acids contain six important isomers like (1) 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-Boswellic acid (AKBA), (2) 11-keto-β-Boswellic acid(KBA) (3) acetylated α and β Boswellic acids(ABA) and (4) α and β-Boswellic acids(BA)which are closely related isomers and are difficult to separate . These isomers exhibit anti-inflammatory activitythrough 5-LOX pathway and anti-cancer activity by binding to Topoisomerase II. By carrying out in-silico studyof their binding to anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer targets, it was found that the AKBA isomer is the mostpotent and it was confirmed by experimental results published by various groups. Therefore, an attempt wasmade to carry out acetylation of boswellic acids extract to convert the non-acetylated isomers to acetylatedisomers like ABA and AKBA to enhance the potency of the extract. The boswellic acids suffer from pooraqueous solubility. To improve their aqueous solubility, the boswellic acids were encapsulated with betacyclodextrin. The product was then spray dried to get micronized spray dried powder which exhibit higheraqueous solubility and can be administered in capsules as an oral dosage form. To develop topical formulation,the diethyl amine salt of boswellic acids was prepared and a comparative evaluation of anti-inflammatory activityof all these products was carried out on a rat paw edema model.Anti-cancer activity was evaluated using HumanAspartyl –beta-Hydroxylase(HAAH) as a target enzyme in Real Time PCR.\"},{\"title\":\"Extraction, Identification and authentication of Boswellic Acid derivatives by HPTLC Method.\",\"subtitle\":\"Current trends in pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 2020, Vol (2) 1:49-56.\",\"date\":\"January 1, 2020\",\"description\":\"Boswellia serrata is a deciduos tree in the Burseraceae family.
