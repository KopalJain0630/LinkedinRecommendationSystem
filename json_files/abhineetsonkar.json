He led a cross-functional team of various specialist roles (all of them deserving huge credits too!), driving both his team and his clients (us) with amazing discipline and efficiency (and significant quantity of Post-it!) to deliver results beyond expectations. Abhineet is one of the people I would want on my teams anytime! He will get the results needed, creating great teams from a collection of skilled individuals and importantly still have fun on the way! One of the pleasure of life is to simply meet and admire good people like Abhineet! ”",
        "Shruti Padilla “I have been Abhineet's client on various engagements with BeyonDigital over the past year. It has been a pleasure working with Abhineet. Abhineet has lead our projects with the utmost attention to detail, keen understanding of strategy and goals, and superb project management. He is extremely hardworking, dedicated and focused. Two of my favorite things about Abhineet are his ability to listen and his learning agility. These attributes make it very easy to collaborate with him. He approaches all projects with his customer in mind...truly embodying the empathy aspect of Design Thinking. Abhineet is kind, respectful and maintains a great level of professionalism in all circumstances. He genuinely cares about doing high caliber work to ensure that his clients succeed and achieve their objectives. I look forward to the opportunity to work with Abhineet again in the near future.”"
