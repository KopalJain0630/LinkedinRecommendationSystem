However, over the past four-five years, the economy has gone off the fast-growth track, hastened by the Covid-19 pandemic.For India to capture global markets, it must focus on boosting technology and digitalisation, strengthening environmental laws, and undertaking tax and business reforms.To catapult to economic prosperity, India not only needs to think bigger but also act better.\"},{\"title\":\"Multilateralism can build a universal health strategy\",\"subtitle\":\"The Sunday Daily Guardian\",\"date\":\"December 26, 2021\",\"description\":\"The world is nowhere close to the end of the pandemic. We are straddling a potential new wave with massive unvaccinated factions and anarchistic spread of the virus. The spotting of Omicron gives prominence to the need for multinational cooperation to thwart the pandemic. It calls for an urgent fundamental reset and global health strategy to stave off another big disaster.Today with the world’s dwindling biodiversity and climate crisis marked by international symposia, health securities are inextricably linked. To mitigate this primary global challenge, nations should engage in broad dialogues across the globe. We should demonstrate the transfer of vaccines and technology to solidify equity across countries. More than ever, we need to embrace the spirit of partnership to assure that we can put the pandemic behind us.\"},{\"title\":\"The burden of examination in times of Covid\",\"subtitle\":\"The Daily Guardian\",\"date\":\"April 12, 2021\",\"description\":\"It appears to be the most terrible time for the young generation in India. With blurred announcements on the upcoming Board examination which supposedly was to be held in March, the student’s mental peace and health are being troubled more. As India witnesses the second wave of Covid-19, normal conduct of the board exams will not be efficient. Yet, the Ministry of Education is not likely to take any decision on the cancelation of the exams. With the government giving the least importance to the education sector during the pandemic, it creates an urgency to understand the resilience of board exams.The board examination for Class X and XII should have been taken as per the normal schedule in March. However, elections and religious occasions stand out to be of prime importance in India. With such a mindset, the student’s future has been neglected. Now, with a ballooning number of cases, the Education Board seeks to conduct the exams in normal mode steering to a complete mess.Education is a means to develop the fundamental skills of a child. With more than one lakh daily Covid-19 cases, the decision to conduct the board exams has thrown the entire education system into qualm. No parents are ready to send their children to the exam hall at the cost of their lives. To sustain the meaning of learning, the nation needs to come on grounds to understand the lives and challenges of students, parents, teachers, and the entire education system.\"},{\"title\":\"Gender gap: Making the case for diversity \",\"subtitle\":\"The Financial Express\",\"date\":\"April 1, 2021\",\"description\":\"What can India learn from Nordic countries to close the gender gap?India has slid 28 spots to rank at 140 among 156 countries on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap index. The pandemic causing a disproportionate impact on women jeopardizes rolling back the little progress made in the last decades—forcing more women to drop off the workforce and leaving them vulnerable to domestic violence.Parity is not a zero-sum game, but a common spur and a pragmatic imperative. India should focus on targeted policies and earmarked public and private investments in care and equalized access. Women are not ready to wait for another century for equality. It’s time India accelerates its efforts and fight for an inclusive, equal, global recovery.\"},{\"title\":\"How India can become a global hub for manufacturing & resilient supply chains\",\"subtitle\":\"The Daily Guardian\",\"date\":\"March 1, 2021\",\"description\":\"India has a golden shot to embark on global supply chains. Covid-19 has caused huge disruption across demand and supply. Corporations are relocating their geographic base from susceptible market origins to more credible and economical kernels. Precisely, companies are trying to diversify their production base from China to other stable countries. With strong macroeconomic fundamentals, demographic dividend, highly-skilled English-speaking workforce, ease of doing business, cheap labor costs, enormous resource accesses, and an expanding market of 1.3 billion people, India has an exclusive chance to be the favorable investment destination across the globe.\"},{\"title\":\"Is this an Asian Century? Potential and Challenges in Asia Growth \",\"subtitle\":\"The Financial Express\",\"date\":\"March 1, 2021\",\"description\":\"A diverse politically fragmented region with the immense potential of production and utilization, Asia sets out to be the future for global economic prosperity. Europe governed the 19th-century while the United States dominated the 20th century. Forthwith, the 21st century belongs to Asia. If Asia remains united and cooperates amicably, Asia’s strength will expand to foster exclusive growth patterns. It will then not only be the manufacturing hub for products and services but also become the global powerhouse to drive-in innovation for economic prosperity\"}]",
