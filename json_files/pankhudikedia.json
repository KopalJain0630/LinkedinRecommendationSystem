During her tenure as an Intern at Storysutra.in, she has been working really hard and has always encouraged and guided her other team members, even in the areas beyond the routine roles and responsibilities. She will prove to be a Precious asset for any organization, Always. I wish her all the very best for her bright future. ‚Äù",
