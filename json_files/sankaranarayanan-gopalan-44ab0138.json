    "about": "I am a Physics faculty envisaging to invokve myself actively in Quantum science and computing related research with Genomics, Supply chain. I was a Research Scholar aspiring to provide solutions for Real-time issues and challenges in the field of supply chain science, supply chain engineering, management coupled with mechanism design theory and market design tools through Academic and Industrial collaboration(s) earlier with IIT Kharagpur. I love to explore new avenues , expand research horizons, expand knowledge with the philosophy of research with no boundaries. I had served as a adhoc faculty at NIT-Trichy during where I had taught Operations Research and HRM courses along with exploring new mentoring and pedagogical approaches to deliver concepts. I had reviewed technical submissions in the journals CAIE, JIMS, Information Science, International Journal of System Science in the past.",
