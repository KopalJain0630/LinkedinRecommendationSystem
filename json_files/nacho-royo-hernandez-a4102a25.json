Working on the same brand accounts as well as pitching together clearly showed me that he is a one-of-a-kind Partner Consultant, who thinks very strategically and solution-oriented. He is always willing to go the extra mile, no matter what.‚Äù",
        "Sylvano Varlet ‚ÄúIt was great to work with Ignacio at AUTO1. We had the opportunity to develop very efficient direct partnership in order to consolidate our strength on the European's car industry market. We had the chance to work closely to big company such as Schibsted Media or Altice Media. Ignacio was always behind us and pushing us to overcome with our different projects and targets. I learned a lot about being more a sales person while working with him. I am now looking forward to maybe have the opportunity to work again together.‚Äù"
