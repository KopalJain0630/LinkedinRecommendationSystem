        "Ankit Agarwal “It was delight to work with Mehul during his internship with Vahan. Mehul brought a great mix of strategic thinking backed by exemplary tactical execution. He was super quick to pick up the necessary information and context on the project despite working in a complete remote setting. Moreover, he used his technical expertise to automate his day to day tasks on the project but also fundamentally reduce the effort needed for transition of the project. The project he built from scratch is now being productized which is a testament to the ownership and the results Mehul delivered on the project”"
