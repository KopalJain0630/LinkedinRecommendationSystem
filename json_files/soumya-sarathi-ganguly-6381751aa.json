According to WHO database the spread of infection has resulted in over 30 million infected people and over 943000 deaths worldwide till 19th September, 2020. Till date, unavailability of vaccines and specific antiviral drugs is a cause of grave concern. Worldwide,the search for the specific an￾tiviral medication is underway. The Drug controller General of India (DCGI) has recently approved Favipiravir for emergency usage in mild to moderate Covid19 Indian patients. Favipiravir, an old antiviral drug marketed under the brand name Avigan by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd, Japan, originally produced for Ebola Virus Disease has shown affirmative results in the treatment of CO￾VID-19 across the globe. This article is an updated literature review conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of the drug Favipi￾ravir (FPV) in general and in the treatment of COVID-19 across the globe. An extensive search was performed using keywords such as Favipiravir and SARSCoV-2 in platforms like Google Scholar and PubMed for the time period of 1st June 2000 to 31st July 2020. Common adverse effects of the drug include increased Liver enzymes and hyperuricaemia. Trials reported from Japan and Russia has proved the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in Covid19 although published data from an Indian clinical trial is awaited. It appears to be a promising drug considering its oral formulation and safety profile, however, efficacy data from Indian patients are still awaited to recommend its wide spread usage.\"}]",
