        "“Ram would serve as a classic example of working under a leadership which is young and dynamic and at the other end of the spectrum showcases a maturity of a seasoned professional. Like an iceberg, at the onset he displays some features of leadership, but as you sink deeper into your roles, you realize the depth of his knowledge and grasp over subject. He is amazing at breaking down subject matter or problem statement and simplifying it to you as if its being addressed to a kid. The other aspect that is a distinctive feature about his leadership is the ability to stay cool even when the things go wayward. In my experience working with him I have found him to stay calm and collected while purely focusing on diffusing the tension and constantly working on the result. I continue have the privilege of continuing to continue working with him and being able to share my career journey learning and sharing with him” Show less"
