        "Shyam Pillalamarri ‚ÄúAkash has worked under me during his stint with Amec Foster Wheeler Fired Heaters group. He exhibited extreme competency while handling several projects and proposals at the same time by ensuring quality delivery on schedule. He is a sincere, hardworking and dedicated professional and forms an excellent member of the team. He never fails to put forward his viewpoint and consistently looks for more innovative and better ways to approach a task which is very rare. He is the youngest engineer of the Fired Heaters Chennai group to attend a Client Meeting at Reading Head Office of Amec Foster Wheeler. There, he demonstrated confidence and excellent communication as well as technical skills while engaging with Clients and vendors from varied nationalities like South Korean, British and Spanish. He has a positive outlook towards life and manages to positively influence individuals around him with his strong work ethics, discipline and jolly nature. Over the course of our professional engagement, I come to know Akash personally as a caring & respectful person, a dear rational subordinate and a wonderful human being. It was a pleasure to have him in my team and he is an asset to any organization. I wish him all the best for his future endeavors.‚Äù"
