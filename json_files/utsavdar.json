His innovative ideas and his ability to think out of the box makes it a joy work with and learn from him. He is one of those rare leaders who also naturally serves as an inspiring mentor for all who work for him. The kind of expertise he has with work, with his Business and Tech background is immense. He spreads his knowledge and experience amongst peers and team members. Although he's a hardcore businessman, his unique ability is empathy. His capability to motivate a team to care for the project at hand enables him to achieve what's seen as unachievable. Utsav is the go-to person for conflict resolution and problem solving. He's never the one to draw attention to himself and is a total team player. His positive attitude at tough times further add to why he is so respected. Having first hand experience of working with him, I highly recomend him professionally.”",
