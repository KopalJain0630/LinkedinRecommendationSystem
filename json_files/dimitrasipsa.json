The aim of this project is to familiarise our students with modern diplomatic practices, develop their critical and analytical skills, improve their ability to cooperate with each other, and communicate their ideas in public. Our cooperation with the British Embassy will provide the springboard for this project and allow our students to learn about contemporary issues of British Foreign Policy, and enhance their knowledge of British policies as well as of the British Diplomatic Service.The pilot project was initiated and supervised by Dr Revecca Pedi. This project is part of the course \\\"Modern Diplomacy, Economy, and Business\\\".The Project: The processStudents are entrusted with the task to advise the British Ambassador on British Priorities in the region, internationally, and regarding bilateral relations with Greece as well as on special issues.Students were briefed on the different priorities by Diplomats from the British Embassy, Jaimie Turner, Counsellor Political, and Valerie Benguiat, First Secretary in Public Diplomacy.Students were divided into five working groups, consisting of four or five persons each.Each priority topic was assigned to a group. What we expected from the groups was to do high-quality research for their topics, commit to the project, excel in group work and work on innovative ideas.There is a halfway assessment of their progress where we discuss in class their achievements and difficulties.Students receive feedback from their supervisor and their fellow students.Finally, the groups present their ideas to the UK Ambassador in Greece.\"}]",
