    "about": "I am passionate about anything which flies. That's how I landed at this profession. From very small age I wanted to be an Aeronautical Engineer and when I was done with high school studies, I joined an institute in Bengaluru, India for Aircraft Maintenance Engineering (AME). While doing that course, I joined for BE Aeronautical Engineering under Aeronautical Society of India as correspondence (AMAeSI). I completed AME by Aug 2010 and AMAeSI by June 2013. After completion of undergraduate course, I cleared an all India graduate entrance examination conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay with an all India rank of 151 and got admission in IIT Khargapur for Masters in Aerospace Engineering. After completion of my masters, I joined Skydive Dubai in Aircraft Maintenance Department as Aircraft Maintenance Technician. Once I cleared exams for being a Certifying staff, I started working as AME in Skydive Dubai. I worked in Skydive Dubai for 8 years and 10 months and then moved to Canada. Currently I am working in Canada as Aircraft Maintenance Technician for Echo North Aero Services.",
