        "Shrashti Singhal “I had the pleasure of working closely with Sayantan for a year, during which he served as an invaluable member of our team as an NLP intern. As a Principal Data Scientist, I had the opportunity to witness Sayantan's dedication, technical proficiency, and strong work ethic firsthand. Sayantan consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and methodologies. He actively contributed to various projects, showcasing his ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges. His commitment to excellence was evident in the high-quality deliverables he produced throughout his tenure. One of Sayantan's standout qualities is his capacity to grasp complex NLP concepts swiftly and apply them effectively to project requirements. His analytical skills and attention to detail were instrumental in solving intricate problems, and he consistently delivered work that exceeded expectations. Beyond technical proficiency, Sayantan was a collaborative team player who seamlessly integrated into our dynamic work environment. His effective communication skills and willingness to take on new challenges made him an asset to the team. Whether working independently or as part of a group, Sayantan consistently demonstrated a positive and proactive attitude. I highly recommend Sayantan to any organization seeking a talented and motivated individual with a solid foundation in NLP and a proven track record of delivering results. It was a pleasure working with Sayantan, and I am confident that he will continue to excel in his future endeavors.”",
        "Dr. Param Jeet “Sayantan is a very dedicated resource as I worked with him on couple of Data science initiatives and he single handedly managed and delivered whole piece within assigned time frame. His knowledge on General data science, ML and NLP is commendable. I wish you all good luck in your future.”"

Through extensive research, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the various models implemented over the years and the different metrics and loss functions used for reconstruction. We focused primarily on brain MRI data from the widely used MICCAI dataset and designed a model that would improve the quality of reconstruction. Our experiments involved testing various optimizers and activation functions to identify the optimal combination that would achieve the best results.The insights and knowledge gained from our project will prove invaluable in advancing the use of compressed sensing technology in the medical field and beyond.\"},{\"title\":\"BTP 2 THESIS : IMPLEMENTATION OF FACTORIZED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPUTATION WITH DIFFERENT MODELS\",\"subtitle\":\"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur\",\"date\":\"April 30, 2022\",\"description\":\"Computation is a big factor when we try to implement convolutional neural networks so we need so factorization in the layers, CP decomposition can be a technique we can try to implement in the convolutional layers such that the idea of the models helps to get trained faster, in this thesis, we are going to impediment wider networks to factorized layers such that the models become efficient and fast, also we are going to analyze the computation time and effect on the accuracy of the model to find out the best solution to our problem statement.\"},{\"title\":\"BTP 1 THESIS : IMPLEMENTATION OF TENSOR DECOMPOSITION ON DIFFERENT AREAS OF COMPUTER VISION\",\"subtitle\":\"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur\",\"date\":\"November 18, 2021\",\"description\":\"Tensor decomposition is a part of multilinear algebra under which we do the factorization of tensors depending upon the type of data and its use. In computational work, this method tremendously decreases the computational time and makes the process faster by making more efficient convolutional models.In this project, we aim to decompose the image tensor while keeping the accuracy of the image model intact.Our project only focuses on the image Tensor and does not change the algorithmic structures and model in any way so that the model accuracy or the loss should not get affected the model. We have implemented the whole experiment in real-world datasets so that we can understand the real-world difficulties and thus make thisparticular project sustainable. Along with the implementation; we are also focusing on the research part by theoretical and algorithmic understanding, to implement the research to obtain the results that we are aiming for as a result i.e. less computation time with maximum accuracy.\"}]",
