Sahil had very little experience when he started, but he demonstrated enormous dedication and learned many different technologies from this experience. Except for Thorntail and Quarkus, he also studied Maven and Java. After the project, he was ready for a junior Java engineering position. Sahil is a dedicated software engineer who likes to learn new things and doesn't hesitate to take on even harder challenges.”"
