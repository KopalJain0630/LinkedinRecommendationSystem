        "Clémentine Chardon Andréoli🖋️ “Olivier a été mon coach pendant plus de 3 mois, il m'a aidé sur de nombreux points professionnels comme personnel. Il m'a permis de comprendre la différence entre confiance en soi, estime de soi et ego. Nous avons aussi travaillé sur l'équilibre pro/perso, qui est sujet important en tant qu'indépendante, ainsi que la gestion de plusieurs projets (entreprises) de front en respectant ses besoins sans culpabiliser de ne pas être assez productive. Nous avons aussi travaillé sur mes objectifs, ce qu'il représente, les méthodes pour les atteindre. Il a su parfaitement s'adapter à moi, comprendre mon fonctionnement pour me faire évoluer et grandir en tant qu'humaine et entrepreneuse. Je vous le recommande très fortement, car il saura prendre en compte vos besoins et contraintes pour vous permettre d'évoluer ainsi que de changer de perspective pour progresser. Il est très humble, cultivé et intelligent tout en étant à l'écoute sans jamais juger. Il a une immense bienveillance et empathie qui fait qu'en tant que coach, il saura trouver les mots justes pour chaque situation. L'expérience qu'il a acquise dans le coaching en gérant plusieurs entreprises fait qu'il est le coach parfait pour tout entrepreneur.”",
        "Raymond Miranda “Olivier and I started a casual conversation on the future of Digital Coaching - and very gradually he moved that conversation from casual to advising to coaching. I almost missed these transitions because it felt like such a natural progression. If coaching is an art, then Olivier has the heart of an artist. He looks at every conversation as something to be observed, explored, and co-created. He is more interested in the questions and where they can lead us than merely pushing for outcomes. The best coaches I have had asked the best questions. Olivier asked me a pivotal question that might have saved me years in chasing the wrong customer. ”"
