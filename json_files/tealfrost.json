        "Athena ~ ‚ÄúTeal is a distinctly adept recruiter. Everything from her talent engagement method, to her guidance throughout the interview process, all the way to her closing skills are top tier. Easily top 1% recruiter I've interacted with. I sincerely hope to work with Teal in the future!‚Äù",
        "Elisabeth Dick Oak, a.k.a. EDO ‚ÄúTeal and I worked together while she was at Interbrand and, as a director in the Verbal Identity department, I could not have asked for a better talent acquisition partner. Teal's point of view is that you can't hire for a position unless you really understand the discipline you're hiring for and her enthusiasm came through in how she put this into practice. She went above and beyond to learn everything she could about Verbal Identity. From attending our team meetings to reviewing client presentations to chatting regularly about the mix of creative and strategic skills that make up the ideal Verbal Identity candidate. When you got a resume from Teal, you knew that she'd selected it with specific criteria in mind. Some of our best team members came into the department when Teal was at Interbrand. I miss her insightful take on candidates, her easy way of managing the hiring process for them and, of course, the way she lights up whatever room she walks into. Any firm would be lucky to have her.‚Äù"
