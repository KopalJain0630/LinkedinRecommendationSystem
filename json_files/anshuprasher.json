Never seen an occasion when the gentleman in question was found wanting in energy or effort. One of the very informed persons in his domain, have seen him easily adapt to various roles assigned to him. His ability to sustain consistent interactions with any client that he has ever worked with (deal or no deal) is something that I have always found worth emulating. He is someone with whom you would be able to speak at length on any issue - business, cricket (not without confirming your reverence for SRT), movies, places, anything - and come out more informed.”",

His positive attitude and eagerness to deliver are note-worthy. Sharp minded and great drive. I wish him all the best. And I look forward to working with him again in my career.”"
