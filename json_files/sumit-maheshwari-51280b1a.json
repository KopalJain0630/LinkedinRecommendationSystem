        "Saurav Atri ‚ÄúSumit is one of the most level headed individuals that I have ever met. His maturity and calm attitude is truly remarkable. In addition to being a brilliant leader, he can manage complex individual tasks with ease. I have had the pleasure of working with him on the Graduate Student Board at the Indian School of Business where he was elected as the treasurer. He is very methodological in his approach to work and and is an excellent finance wiz. I will strongly recommend him for his ability and knowledge in the finance profession.‚Äù",
        "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúSumit is very smart, confident and hard-working. His attention to detail in managing the Treasury of the ISB Graduate Student Association was second to none. He developed sound policies, allocated funds fairly and budgeted successfully. He diffused conflicts with his pleasant demeanour and was assertive when he needed to be. Sumit is a pleasure to work with.‚Äù"
