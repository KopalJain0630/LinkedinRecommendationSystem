Each hybrid supply chain involves formulating and solving a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The availability of excess sugar plays a central role in designing each supply chain.The study utilizes six types of biomass residues as the biomass source for ethanol production, employing dilute acid and convective drying pretreatment alongside enzymatic transesterification. It aims to determine optimal locations and capacities for biomass harvesting sites, sugar mill cluster points, and biorefineries, concurrently with identifying petroleum refinery locations. The supply chain networks are developed, and NPV is maximized through strategic decision-making.Furthermore, the financial feasibility of proposed biorefineries, influencing biorefinery location choices, is rigorously evaluated. The thesis includes rigorous comparisons to identify the most efficient supply chain and tests the supply chains with various cases of uncertainties and restrictions.\"},{\"title\":\"SIMULTANEOUS PROCESS AND SOLVENT OPTIMIZATION OF ANTI-SOLVENT CRYSTALLIZATION\",\"start_date\":\"Jun 2020\",\"end_date\":\"Feb 2021\",\"description\":\"Solvent usage constitutes a significant environmental waste stream in the pharmaceutical industry. Anti-solvent crystallization is commonly employed in pharmaceutical processes to separate and purify intermediate compounds and active ingredients.This study introduces a computational framework that simultaneously selects and optimizes solvents for a continuous process involving crystallization, coupled with flash vaporization and distillation for recycling the anti-solvent. A unified perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) model is used to predict thermodynamic properties relevant to solubility and vapor-liquid equilibrium, integrated with a process model. A continuous mapping approach is utilized to effectively solve the optimization problem.Additionally, a genetic algorithm is applied to optimize integer variables associated with the process superstructure. This hybrid stochastic and deterministic optimization framework transforms the original mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem into a computationally tractable nonlinear programming (NLP) problem.The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a case study on the continuous anti-solvent crystallization of paracetamol.\"},{\"title\":\"BIO-FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION\",\"start_date\":\"Jul 2019\",\"end_date\":\"Apr 2020\",\"description\":\"This project presents an optimization study focusing on the net present value (NPV) of a biomass-to-biofuel supply chain, integrated with the petroleum supply chain across India.
