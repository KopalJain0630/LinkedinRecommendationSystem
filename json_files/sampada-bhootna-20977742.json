        "Gaurav Bansal “I had the pleasure of working closely with Sampada on a few strategic Google accounts. What really stood out for me was her proactiveness, customer centric approach and how she was able to carry various Google PAs together in order to meet the customer objectives. Our engagements together were short but very solid. I wish her the very best !”",
        "Tom Thai “Sampada is an A+ person, professional, and teammate. I was lucky to work with Sampada while at Google. What stands out most about Sampada: (1) Figuring out immense complexity, quickly - We all know that Google is a very big and complex company, with many product areas, complex stakeholder relationships, etc. Sampada came into Google and through a combination of her emotional intelligence and hard work, really figured out how the company and its people worked. This is in the \"big company\" context but this intangible skill can also be applied to startup contexts, where the company and technology are just beginning to form - there are different complexities and ambiguities to figure out there. Sampada would excel. (2) Strong drive to make a difference - I observed that Sampada was always pushing hard to make meaningful impact in her work. Both to benefit Google but also to benefit her external partners and the ecosystem as a whole. It's not always easy to chart a path where everyone wins equally but Sampada has a great mindset as well as skillset to do that. (3) Overall great teammate and super positive - When you're around Sampada and talk to her, you can't help but feel lifted up. Sampada brings her positive energy and finely-tuned smarts to every interaction. I hired Sampada at Google and I'd do it again any day, in any context (whether at Google again or in a startup context). If you're in a position to hire Sampada and want to speak live for a reference, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I will respond immediately.”"
