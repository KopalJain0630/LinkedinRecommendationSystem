She showed strong attention to detail & completely owned the tasks she was involved in. I would highly recommend her for all the above reasons.‚Äù",
        "Prasad Tanaji Dalvi ‚ÄúYachana was part of my team initially as an intern and then as a technology analyst during first year of her career, Yachana has excellent work ethics and takes accountability of every task she gets involved in. Despite being the lockdown period and virtual internship, Yachana was pro-actively connecting with her leads, asking questions upfront, providing regular updates and developed an API validation framework MVP within her short internship duration. When back as Technology Analyst, although a career starter, Yachana showed a very fast learning curve, took advantage of every learning opportunity and delivered multiple milestones for the API framework and Python modules. Her professionalism and partnership are admirable. She is also actively involved in team engagement events, is a sports-person and has an ability to make connections across the teams easily. For all her contributions while she worked in the F1 team, I would highly recommend her for her professional, technical and personal skills.‚Äù"

We have found that static algorithms work better than dynamic algorithms for certain applications, so we have tried to combine features of dynamic load balancing with static to achieve optimum performance on various parameters. We propose this approach because it is easy to implement and its performance is very comparable to dynamic algorithms considering desirable features of both have been used to create the algorithm and minimize the drawbacks.\"}]",
