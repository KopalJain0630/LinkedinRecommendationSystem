We worked together for about a year and collaborated on several projects ranging from operations to logistics. His ability to motivate people and steer the team in right direction is outstanding, which is evident in the way he has driven the factory in which we worked together towards sustainable profits. Adding to this, he has a very good connect with the entire team... no matter how tense was the meeting, Ketan always made sure that everyone left with a smile. As member of any team or a manager, Ketan earns my highest recommendation!”"
