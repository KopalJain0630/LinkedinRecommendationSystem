I trust him to always deliver more than he promises. He is a great team player and gets along with cross-functional partners within the company. I have seen Abhishek perform in a highly complex and ambiguous setup. His ability to filter out the noise and focus on impact is quite unique and shows his potential to become a successful leader in the near future. I am quite confident that Abhishek will scale great heights in his career and emerge as a popular growth marketer in the country, and hopefully, in the world. ”"
