She liaisoned with various internal and external contributors, that ensured as guests we felt seamless experience in handling of the invitation and registration process, logistics of transportation and accommodation, and delivering the event agenda over a packed three day schedule. The entire event ran like clockwork and the entire visiting alumni group provided feedback that this was one of the best events that most of us had experienced recently.
