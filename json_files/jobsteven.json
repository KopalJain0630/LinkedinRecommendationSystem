The prediction signifies motivation and good learning with reduced cost and time, enough reasons to believe that VR teaching may become the only choice in future.\"},{\"title\":\"Robots In Mining\",\"subtitle\":\"Springer Singapore: Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering , #228\",\"date\":\"December 21, 2021\",\"description\":\"This paper explores some of the forthcoming consequences of robots and its’ usage in the mining business are fewer man mining, human in automated systems, amplified realism, nonstop mining, automatic drilling, robot loading and hauling, computerisation of charging and blasting, automation of ascending and strengthening as well as automation of the broadcasting system.\"},{\"title\":\"Development of Architecture of Autonomous Hydraulic Rock Breaker for Limestone Mines\",\"subtitle\":\"Springer Singapore: Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering , #228\",\"date\":\"December 20, 2021\",\"description\":\"This study aims to develop an architecture of AI model for rock breakers with autonomous remote operation. Firstly, several technical specifications of various rock breakers mounted on 30 T class hydraulic rock breakers were evaluated. Also, the factors affecting cost and operation were identified and discussed. Later, the autonomous rock breaker installed on the crusher hopper at a site in Australia was reviewed as global technological advancement. Based on the review, a five-stage architecture for developing autonomous hydraulic rock breakers was developed.\"}]",
