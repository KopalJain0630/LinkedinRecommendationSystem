His focus on founders and working hand in hand with them to build their dreams and have impact on the continent truly sets him apart as an investor. He’s also one of the few people I have met with the critical thinking ability to rapidly analyze a business model quickly and effectively. Zach is an asset to any organization he backs as an investor and dramatically helps to create value for all shareholders. ”",

That, combined with unique knowledge of the African startup scene makes him and his friends well-positioned for success in the emergent rise of African tech. His new Launch Africa fund is at the right place at the right time for unprecedented growth in the next two decades. Watch him and this space. ”"
