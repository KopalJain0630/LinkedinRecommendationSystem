        "LinkedIn User “It was a pleasure having known & worked alongside Anshika during our time together at Ditto. Three interesting observations about this young woman is all you need to know about her commitment & work ethics: 1. Anshika, was always on my list of colleagues whose quality of deliverables was good! Never has there been a time where I could turn back to say that her work disappointed the team. 2. This young woman definitely needs applause for her confidence, ability to hold good conversations at work & the level of diligence she maintained at Ditto. Its not something common to witness among young people at work, its a rare quality that Anshika has and I only hope she builds upon her strengths in the years to come. 3. “Dependable”, colleagues who are dependable to me are the ones who communicate well (esp. in remote roles), who follow up diligently and who take up accountability end-to-end. And Anshika definitely ticked that box for me. I am very sure this young lady is going to do wonders in the years ahead of her & I am going to be on the stands cheering for her. Thanks a lot Anshika for the good company during our time at Ditto and all the very best for the road ahead.”",
        "Rohit Ojha “Anshika has consistently been one of the top performers and has shown the ability to manage multiple projects and work on her responsibilities with utmost efficiency. She has great product knowledge and has been one of my go to people for the same.”"
