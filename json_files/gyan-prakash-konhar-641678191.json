He was the most cherished leader of the class, house and one of the top commanders in Scouts & Guides at school. Juniors, Seniors, teachers and even Principal saw him as a good student in terms of academics, cultural events and sports with an intense capability of leading any team he is a part of. He showed his calmness in class and fierceness in sports like Taekwondo and Kabaddi bagging medals for the school. I wish you all the best for future Gyan!”",
