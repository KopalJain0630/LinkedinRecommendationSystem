        "Georgy Egorov ‚ÄúTGF is one of the best gaming investment funds on the market! Let me elaborate on this thesis: 1) The founders and partners are real gaming professionals with extensive experience in both the business and hardcore production sides of the industry. 2) The TGF team is driven and passionate. As a founder, I can feel their dedication to achieving the best possible results. 3) They are always eager to help, no matter what the situation may be. (This is because of point #2.) 4) Ilya and Masha are remarkable individuals. It is always a pleasure to chat with them, even outside of board meetings Having TGF on board is one of our best decisions in KEK.‚Äù",
        "Fuad Kuliev-Smirnov ‚ÄúThat was really cool year of partnership with TGF. I can confidently say that even though I have limited experience working with investment funds, the qualities that Ilya and Maria possess have significantly contributed to the comfort of our collaboration. 1) Proactivity: They've proven themselves to be extremely proactive. Rather than waiting for opportunities to come to them, they sought out partners to co-invest in our funding round, leading a successful deal. 2) Communication: It's an absolute pleasure to converse with them. They possess a keen understanding of the nuances of the gaming industry, which makes our discussions both fruitful and enjoyable. 3) Involvement: Their level of engagement with our project is impressive. Not only do they play the game, but they also provide valuable feedback, share screenshots of bugs, and suggest improvements. Their hands-on approach is very much appreciated. 4) Networking: They've provided fantastic assistance in expanding our network and introducing us to new people. Particularly, their connections with HR companies have been invaluable as we began to scale rapidly. In conclusion, it's been a rewarding experience working with them. Their combination of proactivity, understanding, involvement, and networking assistance truly sets them apart. I highly recommend them to any business looking for a dedicated and insightful investor.‚Äù"
