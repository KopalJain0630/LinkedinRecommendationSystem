He was diligent, persistent and a team player. I really enjoyed working with him. One of the smartest guy who can be trusted :) I wish Prathamesh all the very best for all his future endeavours! ”",
        "Dr. Karthik Seemakurthy “I supervised Prathamesh for his internship at TCS Research and Innovation Labs. The words that best describes Prathamesh are hardwork, perseverance, humble, and obedient. He was one of the best interns that I supervised in the last three years. What I personally like in him is his eagerness to learn new things. Being coming from chemical engineering background, he gave his best efforts to execute the task assigned to him and produced promising results for detecting anomalies from surveillance videos. Prathamesh will be a great asset to any team he works with. ”"
