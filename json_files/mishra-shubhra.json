        "Devashish Mulye “Shubhra joined FinBox in May 2021 as a software development intern in her 3rd year. FinBox is now series-A funded, but was a lean seed-funded start-up back when Shubhra joined. Shubhra displayed remarkably high professional maturity for someone in her stage of career, and took on heavy responsibilities in the development of our flagship product. She intuited what the organization required back then. She understood the business use-case by talking to product managers, and accordingly handled her own engineering tasks. It is commendable how she was able to significantly contribute to the product and our evolving engineering standards in the fast-paced dynamic environment as an intern. I’m sure she will be a valuable addition in any organization or college she choses to be part of.”",
        "Lorenzo Polidori “Shubhra successfully completed her Summer Internship as WhatsApp Technical Programme Manager in September. During her three months in the London office, I was her Intern Manager and I enjoyed introducing her to the TPM role. Shubhra did an exceptional job, above and beyond the expectation for a junior TPM. She onboarded on her project very quickly and with minimal help; she quickly learned about complex technical problems; she met, coordinated and led the cross-functional team shortly after she started; she achieved all the goals in her intern plan; and she received amazing feedback from across the project team. Thanks to her technical skills, positive mindset and determination, I am sure Shubhra will be successful, whatever path she decides to follow in her future.”"
