        "Sima Umathay “I have high respect for Arindam who is one among the top mentors I have been blessed with. Arindam's willingness to share his knowledge, ask straight forward questions and encourage right skills makes him indispensable. One incident I vividly remember is when I was working on a Product and he asked me tough questions which provided clarity and provided direction to proceed with understanding problem. I take this opportunity to thank him for his valuable time and insights during our conversations which has always been inspirational and full of practical ideas to act on. ”",
        "Ravi Singla “Arindam is an exemplary product leader. I directly reported to him in Flipkart for 6 months or so when I was very new to product management. In such a short duration, he managed to leave a lasting impression on me. Arindam empowers his team by giving complete freedom to execute and guiding at the right time. He stays calm and composed even under the most high-pressure situations. He goes out of his way to help his team when needed. It was great working with him and I wish him all the best for future.”"
