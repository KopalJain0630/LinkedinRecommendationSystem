        "Saket Mehrotra “Saurabh Mukherjea is the missing piece of a sane thought leader in the Indian equity markets. In a place that is cluttered with every fund manager/equity expert trying to sell you anything and everything they can, Saurabh has been the calm voice of sanity and prudence. I started taking interest in equities after reading Saurabh's book 'The Unusual Billionaires'. As professor Damadaran says, both numbers and narratives should exist in perfect tandem to complete a valuation exercise, Saurabh has been phenomenal in dissecting the complicated basics for millions of retail investors in the country. Saurabh's newsletters are the Indian equivalent of Howard Marks' memos and the entire investing community looks forward to receiving them. ”",
