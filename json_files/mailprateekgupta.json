During your three sprints over the summer, you helped us explore frameworks for going global, price sensitivities in our financial and operating model and created a pricing calculator for the sales team. These will provide a sound foundation for the charity to operate from in the future. I am grateful to you for your incredible acumen and knack for making highly complex issues appear to be simple. Wishing you all the best in your future - would work with you again in a heart-beat.” Show less",
        "“Prateek led a group of LBS consultants in a project at my startup, Panda Packaging for 3 months. The entire project from start to finish was seamless, and Prateek went above and beyond with his efforts to provide the relevant information we were looking for. His work was instrumental to my startup, as the information collected and analysed, built the foundation required in order for us to proceed with our next steps. Prateek's management of this project was impeccable, communication was excellent, the questions asked made us dig deeper into our work at Panda Packaging and discover some vital findings that we perhaps would not have discovered otherwise. An excellent leader and all in all, Prateek is an absolute pleasure to work with. Thank you Prateek, the team at Panda Packaging really enjoyed having you lead this project! ” Show less"
