I have worked with him on multiple high intensity strategy consulting projects for marquee pharmaceutical clients in APAC and have always thoroughly enjoyed working with him. He is a self starter, always looking to take up additional responsibilities and work for the broader cause of the project team rather than taking up siloed responsibilities. He also demonstrated high maturity and confidence in directly managing analysts on projects. A 'go-getter' with a never say die attitude, it was extremely satisfying to hear a client qualify his work as higher quality and more impactful than that of a leading bulge bracket consulting firm. I strongly recommend Abhilash, for he will be an asset to any consulting organization or project team. I most certainly look forward to working with him again.”",
