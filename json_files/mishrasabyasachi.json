He did an excellent job on a variety of topics - talent strategy, scaling operations, IPO readiness - the list goes on. What stood out to me was his ability to move from one topic to another, gain depth quickly and deliver actionable insights rapidly. He did all this while maintaining a super positive and humble attitude - and was fun to be around.”",
