I wanted to investigate how do chemical companies make their products more circular and then dive deeper into the role Corporate Venture Capital plays in incubating, investing or acquiring external entities for closing the loop. For gathering insights, I spoke to multiple stakeholders, including CEOs, Sr. Managers, and Consultants at CVCs and Sustainability consulting to understand how the industry is grabbing this opportunity. The European Chemical industry is at crossroads, faced with tough competition externally and regulations internally. My hypothesis was that this vehicle of CVC would be a crucial tool in building competitiveness. The thesis discusses the insights gathered from the interviews, some pertinent case studies and suggests a framework for using CVC to further sustainability and closing the loop.\"},{\"title\":\"Green Banking Initiative: Paving the Path to Sustainability at Caisse De'Epargne Cote d'Azur\",\"start_date\":\"Sep 2023\",\"end_date\":\"Jan 2024\",\"description\":\"As a part of the Sustainability Impact Challenge during the MBA, we worked with a French multinational bank to develop policies and products for their aim of becoming greener.
