He would always take the time to sit with me and explain the A to Z of his work, no matter how busy his diary could get. He's a colleague who would keenly listen, redirect your doubts into something positive and will keep you focused and energized with your own work. Nevermind the fact that we were both in two different functions, but how he weaves his passion for his work into a creative storytelling that one can engage in and listen to is something that I will always remember. Great to have worked with you Vivek, it was an honour to have witnessed your exemplary work ethic!”"
