He was the choice for the highest student body elected position. He was a consensus builder and could work through argumentative and ambitious groups of people. He also had some laurels in math classes as a mathematics and computing student. If you get a chance to work with him do, if you can invest him you should. I trust there is a strong mettle here.”",
        "Deepak Chandran(DC) “Puneet is a competent and committed analytics professional who displays an instinctive understanding of consumer behaviour. His hallmark quality is his interest in understanding domains outside his direct purview and contributing meaningfully to these. Also having worked in 3 diverse geographies (India, Singapore, and UAE) he has developed a good understanding of these diverse business environments and has also managed to capitalise on this learning to grow into a highly flexible professional capable of adapting easily to the requirements of working successfully in international teams. Puneet is conscientious, hardworking and ambitious and I wish him the very best in all his future endeavours.”"
