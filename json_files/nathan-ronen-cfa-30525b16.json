        "Joseph Myers, MSF, CFA “I would like to give a shoutout to Nathan and Chalk & Board. Nathan is a phenomenal instructor that has a genuine interest in helping you succeed. He is very accessible and has a unique way of simplifying complex topics and helping to connect the dots in the curriculum. His review videos helped to reinforce topics and his mock exams made me feel ready for exam day. I would highly encourage Nathan and Chalk & Board! ”",
        "John Nick, CFA “I am currently an analyst in private credit after starting my career in investment consulting. I pursued the CFA to build my investment acumen and transition into a direct investing role. Nathan Ronen / Chalk and Board were extremely influential as I prepared for and passed the Level 3 exam. Nathan’s experience as a CFA instructor was apparent from day one as he knows the most important concepts that will be tested and drills them into his students. He is extremely interactive with all of his students as he directly grades all essay responses and is accessible via his direct cell. Nathan drives his students to succeed and is completely aligned with each individual’s success on exam day. I had a great experience with Nathan Ronan and am grateful for the major role he played in obtaining my CFA.”"
