        "Gaurav Aggarwal ‚ÄúKhanjan joined us as an analyst in City Growth Architect role. His excellent problem solving skills and sound business knowledge didn't confine him to only that role but instead he helped us with a lot of initiatives ranging in Growth to Backend Automation to Vendor Partner relationship in the next two and a half years. In these two and a half years, we had very challenging times in Savaari primairity due to the changing industry landscape and we really had to bring our A+ game. Khanjan was a rock solid support during all this time and evolved as a true business leader. Keeping in sync to his contributions, in the last 1 year of his stint with Savaari he was promoted to head Product and helped solve quite significant problems in Ops through technology solutions to provide unmatched customer experience specially for Intercity travel. He had his hometown calling and had to leave Savaari for that. His reference note would be incomplete without mentioning two other things about him. One is that he brings a lot of heart to any problem that he works on and doesn't treat anything as just a task. The result is that you can be assured that the problem will be dealt with in the best possible way. The second is he is very sociable and makes the work environment friendly and lot of fun! ‚Äù",
        "Jayaprakash Jain ‚ÄúKhanjan is a hard-working and enthusiastic individual. His complete involvement in the work assigned along with knowledge of macro-economic factors/issues about the industry, gives him an edge in the field of analytics or strategy. Also, his social media analysis skill is unmatched and it led to Client delight while at AQ. ‚Äù"
