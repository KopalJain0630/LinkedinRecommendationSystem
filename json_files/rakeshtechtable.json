        "Mritunjoy Das ‚ÄúRakesh Raushan was one of the most expressive and funny people I have ever had the pleasure of studying with. He was always quick with a joke or a witty remark, and his sense of humor was contagious. Despite his outgoing personality, Rakesh was also incredibly dedicated to his studies and was always willing to help out his classmates. He was a top-performer in our cohort and consistently ranked among the top students in our class. Despite his academic achievements, Rakesh was also one of the most helpful and kind-hearted people I have ever met. He was always willing to lend a helping hand, whether it was helping a classmate with their homework or simply offering a shoulder to lean on during a tough time. He had a warm and compassionate nature that made him well-liked by everyone who knew him. Although he was a little crinze guy, Rakesh had a big heart and a big personality. He always brightened up the room with his infectious smile and positive attitude. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to study with him at IIT Madras and will always remember him as one of the most memorable and inspiring people I have ever met.‚Äù",
        "Pavan Ghantasala ‚ÄúRakesh is a natural leader trying to take the group along with him. I had a brief experience with him during IIT Madras and Techtable. He is very energetic, go-getter. With his work, he is helping many students and job seekers connecting them through internships, workshops etc. I strongly recommend him to anyone who are looking to be associated with him. ‚Äù"
