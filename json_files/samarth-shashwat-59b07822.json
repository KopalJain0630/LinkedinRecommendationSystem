        "Kunal Kapadia “I haven't seen a such a great passionate person for finance like Samarth in my life. His passion and love for finance and economics makes him different from other. Having studied for 2 years and working in tandem for some projects with him I learnt a lot; not just finance but also other managerial skills. He is simply an exceptional personality with big heart who always helps other. His attitude and approach towards this area will definitely put him into the great heights.”"
