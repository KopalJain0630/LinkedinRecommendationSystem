        "Ashhar Akhlaque ‚ÄúAman joined as an intern and worked with us for 4 months. I have rarely seen interns taking full ownership of project, esp that has many unknown parts. But not only did Aman take ownership, he even added new features to ensure the solution caters to customer's needs as best as possible. He had to work across different functions (esp operations) in order to roll it out effectively to both new and existing users. I would say, he did that very seamlessly. Keep up this learning spirit and continue taking ownership üòä‚Äù"
