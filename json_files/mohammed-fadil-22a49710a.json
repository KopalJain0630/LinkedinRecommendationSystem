        "Nishanth Kumar “It’s rare that you come across standout talent like Fadil. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Fadil for the time we both were part of the Rakuten product team. Though coming from a non-tech background, Fadil quickly got to speed and demonstrated instant impact on driving the product roadmap and use cases by collaborating across multiple teams to deliver results. On account of his mature approach to his responsibilities, I often thought of Fadil as a great collaborator and a team lead. Fadil is dedicated, methodical, and very capable. I was impressed with Fadil’s ability to understand complicated matters even outside of his direct areas of expertise. He shines in a thriving environment and desires to take up challenging tasks that everyone else struggles with. Also, he has the easiness to build good interpersonal relations with others. Additionally, I find his enthusiasm around topics of climate change, sports, and startups very inspiring. I would work with Fadil again without question, and I know he will go on to lead and achieve great things in his career.”",
        "Ben Laws “It was my pleasure to work alongside Fadil for the time we were both part of the Siemens PSE team and I do not hesitate to recommend him. His capacity to build understanding of, discuss, and formulate new ideas in response to a broad range of challenges is exceptional - matched only by his ability to implement solutions and deliver results. From the very start of our engagement at Siemens PSE, which included direct and indirect collaboration on technical projects and strategy development related to the team’s direction, I could tell Fadil was dedicated, motivated, and highly effective. These traits were clear in all his activities, be they consulting projects, knowledge-sharing presentations, or our work together. I particularly appreciated his talent for applying a pragmatic mindset to complex scenarios, with him never failing to keep the big picture front and centre. This skill was much-needed and well-utilised at Siemens PSE given the highly technical nature of the product and evolving business environment. It was Fadil’s dynamic approach to his day-to-day work that I most enjoyed interacting with - indeed I learnt a lot from him in this regard. Whether this was quickly picking up new concepts, challenging existing ideas, or responding to changing projects and priorities, he was rarely fazed. This was especially clear when we started to discuss and investigate new strategic opportunities at the end of his tenure. Working to explore openings within new markets, changes to our product offering, or ways to optimise the team’s operation was a challenge I enjoyed sharing with him and prompted many long, interesting conversations. Whenever I left a meeting with Fadil, I feel I held more knowledge and new ideas but also many questions for myself and my own perspective - his willingness to drive progress and challenge assumptions would be appreciated by any team. On a personal level, Fadil was a source of excellent company throughout our shared time at Siemens PSE. It is always a pleasure to talk to someone with genuine passion for what they do, and genuine belief in the ability of technology to improve our lives - particularly in relation to sustainability and net zero ambitions. I very much hope our professional paths cross again and we can continue to work together. Whatever happens, Fadil has a very successful career ahead of him.”"

The capsules were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and particle size analysis. Surface morphology of the microcapsules was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The microcapsules were incorporated into epoxy resin and coated on a mild steel substrate to form a corrosion resistant organic coating. The self-healing property of coatings loaded with different weight % of microcapsules containing LO + BTA was tested by immersion of the UF coated mild steel specimens in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution. It was analyzed through visual inspection, weight loss measurements, and SEM of the scribed region of coating. It was observed that the addition of microcapsules enhances the corrosion resistance of the scratched samples.\"}]",
