        "Sarla Sharmaüíé ‚ÄúPeople who promote the importance of knowing their own limits through positive actions, and who do not unnecessarily show off their apparent virtue or goodness, are usually people whom we hold in high regard. Such people distance themselves from false or forced humility, from the ‚ÄúI do everything better‚Äù attitude. Their outlook has nothing to do with narcissistic pride or excessive selfishness. These people are known for their \"HUMILITY\", their humbleness, their down-to-earth quality. This is from where sincere and honest efforts come. This is what I have always felt with Divyansh, a real genuine, sweet gem of a person. Divyansh has been ONE of the TOP 5 INTERNS from a batch of 50 Interns for the year 2020. During his internship, he was exposed to the various activities in Market Research. He has been a Team Leader with outstanding performance, partnering with various Market Research Live Projects for Pioneer Management Consultant Pvt Ltd and Her Career Foundation. We found him extremely proactive, with leadership traits, inquisitive, and hard-working. Throughout he had been very much passionate, interested to learn, willing to put his best efforts and get into the depth of the subject to understand it better for implementation and execution. His association with us was very fruitful, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors ‚Äù"
