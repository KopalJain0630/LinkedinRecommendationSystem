        "Nishith Rastogi “Manish led the seed round of Locus.sh and has been a constant mentor throughout our Journey. He has been an observer on our board also and have provided key insights which has helped us shape our journey. I strongly recommend him as an investor, and especially so if you are deep-tech company. He is approachable, and yet hands off in day to day functioning and backs you for the long run. ”",
        "Rakshit Kejriwal “Manish led DropKaffe's 1st round of funding as the lead investor along with many prolific investors from India and U.S. He was instrumental in helping us with structuring the round given his deep expertise of the startup ecosystem and connections with relevant investors, across the globe. Once Manish came on our board, he gave us pointed and very useful guidance as needed, without interfering with our thought process. He has been a true coach and mentor, which every startup requires. Manish was instrumental again in helping us structure our Pre-Series A funding which we recently closed. Manish is highly approachable, always available when the entrepreneur needs him, and is only a whatsapp message away. You can't find a better investor, board member, mentor, and above all a coach, which every startup entrepreneur needs. I wish him all the best for his Venture Fund, and have no doubt it will do exceedingly well in picking some of the best companies!”"
