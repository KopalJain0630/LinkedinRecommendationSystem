        "Matthew M. ‚ÄúNaman is a strong, product-minded engineer, as he demonstrated during his time on the Ledgers engineering team at Modern Treasury. While on the team, Naman built changes to our public APIs, orchestrated a complex backfill, and led an investigation into API performance that resulted in undocumenting API features that were little used, but had big performance implications. I was especially impressed by Naman‚Äôs customer and business focus ‚Äî he consistently brought great questions about our strategy to team meetings and to his review of other‚Äôs work. Naman is a great asset to any team that values full-stack web development knowledge and customer empathy.‚Äù",
        "Daniel Zhang ‚ÄúIt was a pleasure to have Naman as an intern on the Pricing Platform team for summer 2021. Naman was thrown into an environment where he had to rapidly ramp up on Airflow, Kubernetes, Docker, and Python dependency management. With his patience and willingness to learn, he was able to deliver business impact on a critical path service even amidst all the new context. Aside from direct technical contributions, Naman also demonstrated maturity and thoughtfulness regarding his values and career goals. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Naman!‚Äù"
