        "LinkedIn User “I have worked with Sumitra twice in different capacities. First he was a student participating in the Google Summer of Code program where he added key features to greatly improve our Talawa mobile application. In the subsequent year he became a mentor for other students in our internship programs where was a part of our open source supervisory team. On both occasions he made valuable contributions to the success of not just Talawa but also the Palisadoes Foundation. His foundational work as inspired others to seamlessly add new features and become active participants in our community. I highly recommend Sumitra and value his continued support of our open source projects.”",
        "Dominic Mills-Howell “I was a mentor for Sumitra under the Google Summer of Code programme, where he worked with the Palisadoes Foundation. Sumitra has an excellent work ethic coupled with good time management skills which manifested in him being immensely productive in a relative short amount of time and contributing to our organisation meaningful ways. Furthermore, he possesses solid backend skills in MongoDB, GraphQL and Node.js, and was able to come up with clever and intuitive enhancements to the Talawa project (an open source project for managing group activities of both non-profit organisations and businesses) related to the handling of multiple plugins, user management and multi-language support. As a mentor, I've personally learnt much from Sumitra in the way of mobile application (backend) development and maintenance, and highly recommend him for any such position. ”"
