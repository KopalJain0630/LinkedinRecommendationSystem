I had the pleasure of having her lead a pitching workshop for 6 Fash&Tech startups as they were getting ready to pitch to investors at our event. Toot organized the workshop, which included both 1:1 sessions with each startup and a joint session for practicing. She was professional, inspiring and dependable. I would be delighted to work with Toot again in the future and would highly recommend her to anyone who needs a speaker, a speaking coach or any other service.”",
